## Introduction

The recent 2022 census revealed that Mental Health conditions in Scotland have worsened by 50% since 2011. This not only impacts mental well-being but physical too. The rising rate of Heart disease caused deaths in Scotland has changed recently following a successful decrease from 1978 to 2015. By focusing on antidepressant prescriptions as an indication of poor mental health and increased depression rates, this assessment aims to visualize the trend of heart disease deaths and increased depression. Note, antidepressant data represents the winter months of these as SAD rates are greatest during these periods.
