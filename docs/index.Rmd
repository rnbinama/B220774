## Introduction
Mental health and cardiovascular disease are two of the most pressing public health challenges facing Scotland today, with the recent 2022 census revealing that Mental Health conditions have worsened since 2011. The intricate relationship between these conditions is well-documented, with mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety often acting as both risk factors for and consequences of heart disease. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), widely prescribed for the treatment of mental health disorders, offer valuable insights into trends in mental health management. Meanwhile, heart disease mortality rates provide a way to examine the broader impacts of mental and physical health on public health outcomes.

This assessment explores the intersection of mental health and heart disease mortality in Scotland by visualizing combined trends in SSRI prescriptions for fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram. It highlights how mental health and heart disease evolve over time, noting that higher SSRI use in areas of greater socioeconomic deprivation may align with increased heart disease mortality.

Without conducting analysis, this report presents a cohesive and detailed overview of the data, offering foundation for future exploration of these critical public health issues.


## SSRI Prescription Trends in Scotland
The SSRI data represents winter months JAN,FEB,DEC (I may change this though because usage isnt actually highest in the winter as presumed previously)

*End summary n conclusion, particular healthboards stand (Glasgow Lothian) and emntion that itys important to account for population and deomgrahic factors*

### Seasonality
*Could potentialy add a seasonal distribution over recent years to focus on when comparing specific healthboards and SSRI prescriptions later on in the report*

When usage was high, deaths were high too
- Although a direct correlation cannot be inferred from this, we can clearly see that the recent rise in cardiac deaths aligns with the increased usage of SSRIs.  


## SSRIs Mechanisms and Heart Disease
Summary with clincal study demonstrating that there is a link between poor mental health and heart disease (Scotland group and Australian Cohort, large percentage of people who experienced cardiac failure had poor mental health, invclude study statistucs). Additionally, the detrimental physiological effect of SSRIs on cardiovascular health (Breifly describe the biological mechanisms). Explanations and why

### SSRI Prescriptions and Heart Disease Mortality by Healthbord at a specific time (2022, November)
Gt table to demonstrate the differneces between SSRI prescription trends in a healthboard with high deprivation and one with low deprivation SMID(index number). And show SSRI usage per person (using hb_population data) and compare this with heart condition data (try and include standardised format).(This can demonstrate that there is evidence for more deaths where more SSRIs are taken?!?)
*Gt table should show that in healthboard with more SSRI intake, there's more heart mortality and vice versa for low deprivation*
*Table will also include demographics of deaths including sex, age. Older population is dying more from heart failure and men too, but this isn't related to depression data (will be clearly stated, just mentioned)*


##Discussions
###Recommendations/Policy/Regaulation
###Conclusive Remarks and significance of study


##Other suggestions
- Include Metformin usage as well, create a link there as another secondary risk factor
- Heart disease medication prescriptions and trends, particularly the recent introduction of Anticoagulant. (But this technically hasnt helped as such)
