	abstract = {Introduction: Approved disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) lessen inflammatory disease activity that causes relapses and MRI lesions. However, chronic inflammation and demyelination lead to axonal degeneration and neuronal loss, for which there currently is no effective treatment. There has been increasing interest in developing repair-promoting strategies, but there are important unanswered questions regarding the mechanisms and appropriate methods to evaluate these treatments. Areas covered: The rationale for remyelinating agents in MS is discussed, with an overview of both myelin physiology and endogenous repair mechanisms. This is followed by a discussion of the identification and development of potential remyelinating drugs. Potential biomarkers of remyelination are reviewed, including considerations regarding measuring remyelination in clinical trials. Information and data were obtained from a search of recent literature through PubMed. Peer-reviewed original articles and review articles were included. Expert opinion: There are several obstacles to the translation of potential remyelinating agents to clinical trials, particularly uncertainty regarding the most appropriate study population and method to monitor remyelination. Refinements in clinical trial design and outcome measurement, potentially via advanced imaging techniques, are needed to optimize detection of repair in patients with MS.},

	abstract = {The biology of CNS remyelination has attracted considerable interest in recent years because of its translational potential to yield regenerative therapies for the treatment of chronic and progressive demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Critical to devising myelin regenerative therapies is a detailed understanding of how remyelination occurs. The accepted dogma, based on animal studies, has been that the myelin sheaths of remyelination are made by oligodendrocytes newly generated from adult oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in a classical regenerative process of progenitor migration, proliferation and differentiation. However, recent human and a growing number of animal studies have revealed a second mode of remyelination in which mature oligodendrocytes surviving within an area of demyelination are able to regenerate new myelin sheaths. This discovery, while opening up new opportunities for therapeutic remyelination, has also raised the question of whether there are fundamental differences in myelin regeneration between humans and some of the species in which experimental remyelination studies are conducted. Here we review how this second mode of remyelination can be integrated into a wider and revised framework for understanding remyelination in which apparent species differences can be reconciled but that also raises important questions for future research.},

It is however maintained whole life long at lower rate, and myelin sheath is crucial for proper signal transmission and neuronal survival. Unfortunately, OLGs present a high susceptibility to oxidative stress, thus demyelination often takes place secondary to diverse brain lesions or pathologies. OLGs can also be the target of immune attacks, leading to primary demyelination lesions. Following oligodendrocytic death, spontaneous remyelination may occur to a certain extent. In this review, we will mainly focus on the adult brain and on the two main sources of progenitor cells that contribute to oligodendrogenesis: parenchymal oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived progenitors. We will shortly come back on the main steps of oligodendrogenesis in the postnatal and adult brain, and summarize the key factors involved in the determination of oligodendrocytic fate. We will then shed light on the main causes of demyelination in the adult brain and present the animal models that have been developed to get insight on the demyelination/remyelination process.

In recent years, zebrafish have become well established for the study of myelinating oligodendrocyte biology and drug discovery in vivo. Here, by automating the delivery of zebrafish larvae to a spinning disk confocal microscope, we were able to automate high-resolution imaging of myelinating oligodendrocytes in vivo. From there, we developed an image analysis pipeline that facilitated a screen of compounds with epigenetic and post-translational targets for their effects on regulating myelinating oligodendrocyte number. This screen identified novel compounds that strongly promote myelinating oligodendrocyte formation in vivo. Our imaging platform and analysis pipeline is flexible and can be employed for high-resolution imaging-based screens of broad interest using zebrafish.},

	abstract = {Oligodendrocytes form myelin around axons of the central nervous system, enabling saltatory conduction. Recent work has established that axons can regulate certain aspects of oligodendrocyte development and myelination, yet remarkably oligodendrocytes in culture retain the ability to differentiate in the absence of axons and elaborate myelin sheaths around synthetic axon-like substrates. It remains unclear the extent to which the life-course of oligodendrocytes requires the presence of, or signals derived from axons in vivo. In particular, it is unclear whether the specific axons fated for myelination regulate the oligodendrocyte population in a living organism, and if so, which precise steps of oligodendrocyte-cell lineage progression are regulated by target axons. Here, we use live-imaging of zebrafish larvae carrying transgenic reporters that label oligodendrocyte-lineage cells to investigate which aspects of oligodendrocyte development, from specification to differentiation, are affected when we manipulate the target axonal environment. To drastically reduce the number of axons targeted for myelination, we use a previously identified kinesin-binding protein (kbp) mutant, in which the first myelinated axons in the spinal cord, reticulospinal axons, do not fully grow in length, creating a region in the posterior spinal cord where most initial targets for myelination are absent. We find that a 73\% reduction of reticulospinal axon surface in the posterior spinal cord of kbp mutants results in a 27\% reduction in the number of oligodendrocytes. By time-lapse analysis of transgenic OPC reporters, we find that the reduction in oligodendrocyte number is explained by a reduction in OPC proliferation and survival. Interestingly, OPC specification and migration are unaltered in the near absence of normal axonal targets. Finally, we find that timely differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes does not depend at all on the presence of target axons. Together, our data illustrate the power of zebrafish for studying the entire life-course of the oligodendrocyte lineage in vivo in an altered axonal environment.},

	abstract = {Studies of activity-driven nervous system plasticity have primarily focused on the gray matter. However, MRI-based imaging studies have shown that white matter, primarily composed of myelinated axons, can also be dynamically regulated by activity of the healthy brain. Myelination in the CNS is an ongoing process that starts around birth and continues throughout life. Myelin in the CNS is generated by oligodendrocytes and recent evidence has shown that many aspects of oligodendrocyte development and myelination can be modulated by extrinsic signals including neuronal activity. Because modulation of myelin can, in turn, affect several aspects of conduction, the concept has emerged that activity-regulated myelination represents an important form of nervous system plasticity. Here we review our increasing understanding of how neuronal activity regulates oligodendrocytes and myelinated axons in vivo, with a focus on the timing of relevant processes. We highlight the observations that neuronal activity can rapidly tune axonal diameter, promote re-entry of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells into the cell cycle, or drive their direct differentiation into oligodendrocytes. We suggest that activity-regulated myelin formation and remodeling that significantly change axonal conduction properties are most likely to occur over timescales of days to weeks. Finally, we propose that precise fine-tuning of conduction along already-myelinated axons may also be mediated by alterations to the axon itself. We conclude that future studies need to analyze activity-driven adaptations to both axons and their myelin sheaths to fully understand how myelinated axon plasticity contributes to neuronal circuit formation and function.},

In these conditions, resident oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) differentiate into oligodendrocytes that carry out myelin repair. To investigate the cellular dynamics underlying these events, we developed a noninflammatory demyelination model that combines intravital two-photon imaging with a single-cell ablation technique called two-photon apoptotic targeted ablation (2Phatal). Oligodendrocyte 2Phatal in both sexes results in a myelin degeneration cascade that triggers rapid forms of synchronous remyelination on defined axons. This remyelination is driven by oligodendrocytes differentiated from a subset of morphologically distinct, highly branched OPCs. Moreover, remyelination efficiency depends on the initial myelin patterns, as well as the age of the organism. In summary, using 2Phatal, we show a form of rapid synchronous remyelination, mediated by a distinct subset of OPCs, capable of restoring the original myelin patterning in adulthood but not aging.},

These structural and functional elements are responsible for different kidney functions, e.g., blood filtration, waste extraction, salt recovery, and water balance. During pronephros organogenesis, cell differentiation is a key step in generating different cell types in specific locations to accomplish designated functions. However, it is poorly understood what molecules regulate the differentiation of different cell types in different parts of the kidney. Two types of epithelial cells, multi-cilia cells and principal cells, are found in the epithelia of the zebrafish distal pronephric duct. While the former is characterized by at least 15 apically localized cilia and expresses centrin2 and rfx2, the latter is characterized by a single primary cilium and sodium pumps. Multi-cilia cells and principal cells differentiate from 17.5 hours post-fertilization onwards in a mosaic pattern. Jagged2a-Notch1a/Notch3-Her9 is responsible for specification and patterning of these two cell types through a lateral inhibition mechanism. Furthermore, multi-cilia cell hyperplasia was observed in mind bomb mutants and Mind bomb was shown to interact with Jagged2a and facilitate its internalization. Taken together, our findings add a new paradigm of Notch signaling in kidney development, namely, that Jagged2a-Notch signaling modulates cell fate choice in a nephric segment, the distal pronephric duct.},

Widespread interruption of myelin occurs in several mouse models of demyelination, rendering them useful for research. Herein, considerable myelin loss is shown in the optic nerves of cuprizone-treated demyelinating mice. Immuno-fluorescence confocal analysis of the expression and distribution of voltage-activated K+ channels (KV1.1 and 1.2 α subunits) revealed their spread from typical juxta-paranodal (JXP) sites to nodes in demyelinated axons, albeit with a disproportionate increase in the level of KV1.1 subunit. Functionally, in contrast to monophasic compound action potentials (CAPs) recorded in controls, responses derived from optic nerves of cuprizone-treated mice displayed initial synchronous waveform followed by a dispersed component. Partial restoration of CAPs by broad spectrum (4-aminopyridine) or KV1.1-subunit selective (dendrotoxin K) blockers of K+ currents suggest enhanced KV1.1-mediated conductance in the demyelinated optic nerve. Biophysical profiling of K+ currents mediated by recombinant channels comprised of different KV1.1 and 1.2 stoichiometries revealed that the enrichment of KV1 channels KV1.1 subunit endows a decrease in the voltage threshold and accelerates the activation kinetics. Together with the morphometric data, these findings provide important clues to a molecular basis for temporal dispersion of CAPs and reduced excitability of demyelinated optic nerves, which could be of potential relevance to the patho-physiology of MS and related disorders.},

	abstract = {The PI3K-Akt pathway is a major survival pathway activated in cancer. Efforts to develop targeted therapies have not been fully successful, mainly because of extensive internal intrapathway or external interpathway negative feedback loops or because of networking between pathway suppressors. The PTEN tumor suppressor is the major brake of the pathway and a common target for inactivation in somatic cancers. This review will highlight the networking of PTEN with other inhibitors of the pathway, relevant to cancer progression. PTEN constitutes the main node of the inhibitory network, and a series of convergences at different levels in the PI3K-Akt pathway, starting from those with growth factor receptors, will be described. As PTEN exerts enzymatic activity as a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) phosphatase, thus opposing the activity of PI3K, the concerted actions to increase the availability of PIP3 in cancer cells, relying either on other phosphoinositide enzymes or on the intrinsic regulation of PTEN activity by other molecules, will be discussed. In particular, the synergy between PTEN and the circle of its direct interacting proteins will be brought forth in an attempt to understand both the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway and the connections with other parallel oncogenic pathways. The understanding of the interplay between the modulators of the PI3K-Akt pathway in cancer should eventually lead to the design of therapeutic approaches with increased efficacy in the clinic.},

A member of the 'intrinsically disordered' or conformationally adaptable protein family, it also appears to have several other functions. It can interact with a number of polyanionic proteins including actin, tubulin, Ca(2+)-calmodulin, and clathrin, and negatively charged lipids, and acquires structure on binding to them. It may act as a membrane actin-binding protein, which might allow it to participate in transmission of extracellular signals to the cytoskeleton in oligodendrocytes and tight junctions in myelin. Some size isoforms of MBP are transported into the nucleus and thus they may also bind polynucleotides. Extracellular signals received by myelin or cultured oligodendrocytes cause changes in phosphorylation of MBP, suggesting that MBP is also involved in signaling. Further study of this very abundant protein will reveal how it is utilized by the oligodendrocyte and myelin for different purposes.},

Although the underlying aetiology of MS is still not known, we summarise those with most evidence of association. Finally, we aim to present treatment strategies for managing the acute relapse, disease-modifying therapies and MS symptoms.

The disease is thought to be due to a complex interaction between different genetic and environmental factors. The prevalence of MS is rising all over the world, due on one hand to earlier diagnosis and prolonged survival, and on the other to a true increase in incidence of the disease. The diagnosis of MS remains clinical despite recent advances in diagnostics and relies on demonstrating dissemination in space and time while excluding alternative diagnoses. The Mc Donald diagnostic criteria, with their recent 2017 revision, are currently widely accepted in the MS community. Although no cure is yet available, many disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have shown different levels of efficacy in preventing relapses, accumulation of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and disability progression. Current treatment strategies include gradual escalation based on clinical and radiological criteria that determine treatment response, or initial induction with high efficacy DMTs especially in patients with an early aggressive course.},

	abstract = {Glia constitute the majority of the cells in our nervous system, yet there are currently no drugs that target glia for the treatment of disease. Given ongoing discoveries of the many roles of glia in numerous diseases of the nervous system, this is likely to change in years to come. Here we focus on the possibility that targeting the oligodendrocyte lineage to promote regeneration of myelin (remyelination) represents a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis, MS. We discuss how hypothesis driven studies have identified multiple targets and pathways that can be manipulated to promote remyelination in vivo, and how this work has led to the first ever remyelination clinical trials. We also highlight how recent chemical discovery screens have identified a host of small molecule compounds that promote oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro. Some of these compounds have also been shown to promote myelin regeneration in vivo, with one already being trialled in humans. Promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination represents just one potential strategy for the treatment of MS. The pathology of MS is complex, and its complete amelioration may require targeting multiple biological processes in parallel. Therefore, we present an overview of new technologies and models for phenotypic analyses and screening that can be exploited to study complex cell–cell interactions in in vitro and in vivo systems. Such technological platforms will provide insight into fundamental mechanisms and increase capacities for drug–discovery of relevance to glia and currently intractable disorders of the CNS.},

In the pivotal, placebo-controlled phase III DEFINE and CONFIRM trials in adults with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), twice-daily dimethyl fumarate reduced clinical relapse and MRI measures of disease activity and improved some aspects of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). Reduced disability progression was also observed with dimethyl fumarate in DEFINE. Results in predominantly East Asian patients (APEX trial) were reflective of those seen in DEFINE and CONFIRM. Dimethyl fumarate had an acceptable tolerability profile. The most common adverse events were flushing and gastrointestinal events, which were of mild or moderate severity and appear to be largely manageable. Thus twice-daily dimethyl fumarate remains an effective treatment option for use in patients with RRMS, with the convenience of oral administration.},

Depending on the severity, spinal injuries are linked to degeneration of axons and myelin, resulting in neuronal impairment and skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy. The protection of neurons and promotion of myelin regeneration during spinal cord injury is important for recovery of function following spinal cord injury. Current treatments have little to no effect on spinal cord injury and neurogenic muscle loss. Clemastine, an Food and Drug Administration-approved antihistamine drug, reduces inflammation, protects cells, promotes remyelination, and preserves myelin integrity. Recent clinical evidence suggests that clemastine can decrease the loss of axons after spinal cord injury, stimulating the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells into mature oligodendrocytes that are capable of myelination. While clemastine can aid not only in the remyelination and preservation of myelin sheath integrity, it also protects neurons. However, its role in neurogenic muscle loss remains unclear. This review discusses the pathophysiology of spinal cord injury, and the role of clemastine in the protection of neurons, myelin, and axons as well as attenuation of skeletal muscle loss following spinal cord injury.},

	abstract = {A major consequence of traumatic brain and spinal cord injury is the loss of the myelin sheath, a cholesterol-rich layer of insulation that wraps around axons of the nervous system. In the central nervous system (CNS), myelin is produced and maintained by oligodendrocytes. Damage to the CNS may result in oligodendrocyte cell death and subsequent loss of myelin, which can have serious consequences for functional recovery. Demyelination impairs neuronal function by decelerating signal transmission along the axon and has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. After a traumatic injury, mechanisms of endogenous remyelination in the CNS are limited and often fail, for reasons that remain poorly understood. One area of research focuses on enhancing this endogenous response. Existing techniques include the use of small molecules, RNA interference (RNAi), and monoclonal antibodies that target specific signaling components of myelination for recovery. Cell-based replacement strategies geared towards replenishing oligodendrocytes and their progenitors have been utilized by several groups in the last decade as well. In this review article, we discuss the effects of traumatic injury on oligodendrocytes in the CNS, the lack of endogenous remyelination, translational studies in rodent models promoting remyelination, and finally human clinical studies on remyelination in the CNS after injury.},

Drugs are costly from development to market, so that drug repurposing, exploration of existing drugs for novel therapeutic purposes, becomes a wise and popular strategy to raise new treatment options. Clemastine fumarate, different from anti-allergic effect as H1 histamine antagonist, was screened and identified as promising drug for remyelination and autophagy enhancement. Surprisingly, fumarate salt also has similar effect. Hence, whether clemastine fumarate would make a protective impact on neurodegenerative diseases and what contribution fumarate probably makes are intriguing to us. In this review, we summarize the potential mechanism surrounding clemastine fumarate in current literature, and try to distinguish independent or synergistic effect between clemastine and fumarate, aiming to find worthwhile research direction for neurodegeneration diseases.},

	abstract = {Andreas Vesalius is attributed the discovery of white matter in the 16th century but van Leeuwenhoek is arguably the first to have observed myelinated fibers in 1717. A globular myelin theory followed, claiming all elements of the nervous system except for Fontana’s primitive cylinder with outer sheath in 1781. Remak’s axon revolution in 1836 relegated myelin to the unknown. Ehrenberg described nerve tubes with double borders in 1833, and Schwann with nuclei in 1839, but the medullary sheath acquired its name of myelin, coined by Virchow, only in 1854. Thanks to Schultze’s osmium specific staining in 1865, myelin designates the structure known today. The origin of myelin though was baffling. Only after Ranvier discovered a periodic segmentation, which came to us as nodes of Ranvier, did he venture suggesting in 1872 that the nerve internode was a fatty cell secreting myelin in cytoplasm. Ranvier’s hypothesis was met with high skepticism, because nobody could see the cytoplasm, and the term Schwann cell very slowly emerged into the vocabulary with von Lenhossék in 1895. When Cajal finally admitted the concept of Schwann cell internode in 1912, he still firmly believed myelin was secreted by the axon. Del Río-Hortega re-discovered oligodendrocytes in 1919 (after Robertson in 1899) and named them oligodendroglia in 1921, thereby antagonizing Cajal for discovering a second cell type in his invisible third element. Penfield had to come to del Río-Hortega’s rescue in 1924 for oligodendrocytes to be accepted. They jointly hypothesized myelin could be made by oligodendrocytes, considered the central equivalent of Schwann cells. Meanwhile myelin birefringence properties observed by Klebs in 1865 then Schmidt in 1924 confirmed its high fatty content, ascertained by biochemistry by Thudichum in 1884. The 20th century saw X-ray diffraction developed by Schmitt, who discovered in 1935 the crystal-like organization of this most peculiar structure, and devised the g-ratio concept in 1937. A revolution happened around the same time: saltatory conduction, the very reason for myelin existence, discovered by Tasaki in 1939 and confirmed by Huxley and Stämpfli in 1949. After the second world war, widely available electron microscopes allowed Geren to finally discover the origin of myelin in 1954, exactly a century after Virchow coined ‘myelin’ in 1854. Geren had the genial insight that the Schwann cell wraps around the axon and generates a spiral of compacted membrane–myelin. The central origin of myelin took a little longer due to the special configuration of oligodendrocyte distanced from the axon, but in 1962 the Bunges established the definitive proof that oligodendrocyte secretes myelin. The era of myelin biology had begun. In 1973 Norton devised a method to purify myelin which launched the modern molecular era.},

	abstract = {Wolfram syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease characterized by insulin dependent diabetes and vision, hearing and brain abnormalities which generally emerge in childhood. Mutations in the WFS1 gene predispose cells to endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis and may induce myelin degradation in neuronal cell models. However, in vivo evidence of this phenomenon in humans is lacking. White matter microstructure and regional volumes were measured using magnetic resonance imaging in children and young adults with Wolfram syndrome (n = 21) and healthy and diabetic controls (n = 50). Wolfram patients had lower fractional anisotropy and higher radial diffusivity in major white matter tracts and lower volume in the basilar (ventral) pons, cerebellar white matter and visual cortex. Correlations were found between key brain findings and overall neurological symptoms. This pattern of findings suggests that reduction in myelin is a primary neuropathological feature of Wolfram syndrome. Endoplasmic reticulum stress-related dysfunction in Wolfram syndrome may interact with the development of myelin or promote degeneration of myelin during the progression of the disease. These measures may provide objective indices of Wolfram syndrome pathophysiology that will be useful in unraveling the underlying mechanisms and in testing the impact of treatments on the brain.},

	abstract = {Neuroglial cells—usually referred to simply as glial cells or glia—are quite different from nerve cells. The major distinction is that glia do not participate directly in synaptic interactions and electrical signaling, although their supportive functions help define synaptic contacts and maintain the signaling abilities of neurons. Glia are more numerous than nerve cells in the brain, outnumbering them by a ratio of perhaps 3 to 1. Although glial cells also have complex processes extending from their cell bodies, they are generally smaller than neurons, and they lack axons and dendrites (Figure 1.4). The term glia (from the Greek word meaning “glue”) reflects the nineteenth-century presumption that these cells held the nervous system together in some way. The word has survived, despite the lack of any evidence that binding nerve cells together is among the many functions of glial cells. Glial roles that are well-established include maintaining the ionic milieu of nerve cells, modulating the rate of nerve signal propagation, modulating synaptic action by controlling the uptake of neurotransmitters, providing a scaffold for some aspects of neural development, and aiding in (or preventing, in some instances) recovery from neural injury.Figure 1.4Neuroglial cells.

	abstract = {Zebrafish are increasingly being utilized as a model system to investigate the function of the growing list of risk genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. This is due in large part to the unique features of zebrafish that make them an optimal system for this purpose, including rapid, external development of transparent embryos, which enable the direct visualization of the developing nervous system during early stages, large progenies, which provide considerable tractability for performing high-throughput pharmacological screens to identify small molecule suppressors of simple behavioral phenotypes, and ease of genetic manipulation, which has been greatly facilitated by the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technologies. This review article focuses on studies that have harnessed these advantages of the zebrafish system for the functional analysis of genes that are strongly associated with the following neurodevelopmental disorders: autism spectrum disorders (ASD), epilepsy, intellectual disability (ID) and schizophrenia. We focus primarily on studies describing early morphological and behavioral phenotypes during embryonic and larval stages resulting from loss of risk gene function. We highlight insights into basic mechanisms of risk gene function gained from these studies as well as limitations of studies to date. Finally, we discuss advances in in vivo neural circuit imaging in zebrafish, which promise to transform research using the zebrafish model by illuminating novel circuit-level mechanisms with relevance to neurodevelopmental disorders.},

NDDs affect a great percentage of the population worldwide, imposing a high societal and economic burden and thus, interest in this field has widely grown in recent years. Nevertheless, the complexity of human brain development and function as well as the limitations regarding human tissue usage make their modeling challenging. Animal models play a central role in the investigation of the implicated molecular and cellular mechanisms, however many of them display key differences regarding human phenotype and in many cases, they partially or completely fail to recapitulate them. Although in vitro two-dimensional (2D) human-specific models have been highly used to address some of these limitations, they lack crucial features such as complexity and heterogeneity. In this review, we will discuss the advantages, limitations and future applications of in vivo and in vitro models that are used today to model NDDs. Additionally, we will describe the recent development of 3-dimensional brain (3D) organoids which offer a promising approach as human-specific in vitro models to decipher these complex disorders.},

The axons in these regions continue to be myelinated into adulthood in humans, which coincides with maturation of personality and decision-making. Myelin consists of dense layers of lipid membranes wrapping around the axons to provide electrical insulation and trophic support and can profoundly affect neural circuit computation. Recent studies have revealed that long-lasting changes of myelination can be induced in these brain regions by experience, such as social isolation, stress, and alcohol abuse, as well as by neurological and psychiatric abnormalities. However, the mechanism and function of these changes remain poorly understood. Myelin regulation represents a new form of neural plasticity. Some progress has been made to provide new mechanistic insights into activity-independent and activity-dependent regulations of myelination in different experimental systems. More extensive investigations are needed in this important but underexplored research field, in order to shed light on how higher brain functions and myelination interplay in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.},

Here we examined the expression of Cx31.3 (the human ortholog of murine Cx29) in human brain and its relation to the other oligodendrocyte GJ proteins Cx32 and Cx47. Furthermore, we investigated in vitro whether Cx32 mutants with CNS manifestations affect the expression and function of Cx31.3. Cx31.3 was localized mostly in the gray matter along small myelinated fibers similar to Cx29 in rodent brain and was coexpressed with Cx32 in a subset of human oligodendrocytes. In HeLa cells Cx31.3 was localized at the cell membrane and appeared to form hemichannels but no GJs. Cx32 mutants with CNS manifestations were retained intracellularly, but did not alter the cellular localization or function of co-expressed Cx31.3. Thus, Cx31.3 shares many characteristics with its ortholog Cx29. Cx32 mutants with CNS phenotypes do not affect the trafficking or function of Cx31.3, and may have other toxic effects in oligodendrocytes.},

Several immune-mediated destruction mechanisms were previously proposed including different T-cell subsets but complex view on immune system function in patients with MS is missing. In the present study, T-lymphocyte populations and pro-inflammatory as well as suppressive cytokine profiles were evaluated in detail in previously untreated patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). CD4+ and CD8+ naïve, central memory (Tcm), effector memory (Tem), terminal effector memory (Ttem), CD4+ regulatory T-cells (Treg) and CD8+ T-suppressor cells (Ts) were analysed using flow cytometry, and levels of ten plasma cytokines were determined using fluorescent bead-based immunoassay. We evaluated two groups of RRMS with minor (n=33) and major (n=25) clinical impairment and compared them with healthy controls (n=40) in order to detect any correlation between severity of MS clinical symptoms and immune disturbances. Significant differences were noted in CD4+CD45RA+CCR7+ naïve T-cells, CD4+CD45RO+CCR7− and CD8+CD45RO+CCR7− Tem cells, while no differences were recognized in Tcm, Ttem, Treg and Ts cells in RRMS patients. Nine out of ten studied cytokines were disturbed in plasma samples of patients with RRMS. In conclusion, we demonstrate complex immune dysbalances in untreated MS patients.},

The nervous system has provided an excellent model system for understanding this question as it contains two main classes of cell types, neurons and glia. Presynaptic neurons are believed to be precisely matched to their postsynaptic target cells, either muscle cells or other neurons, by a competition for limiting amounts of target-derived neurotrophic factors (Purves 1988). The number of some glial cells that survive also appears to depend on a competition for neuron-derived survival signals. In particular, the number of myelinating glial cells that survive appears to be precisely matched during development to the number and lengths of axons requiring myelination.

	abstract = {The myelination of axons by oligodendrocytes is a highly complex cell-to-cell interaction. Oligodendrocytes and axons have a reciprocal signaling relationship in which oligodendrocytes receive cues from axons that direct their myelination, and oligodendrocytes subsequently shape axonal structure and conduction. Oligodendrocytes are necessary for the maturation of excitatory domains on the axon including nodes of Ranvier, help buffer potassium, and support neuronal energy metabolism. Disruption of the oligodendrocyte-axon unit in traumatic injuries, Alzheimer’s disease and demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis results in axonal dysfunction and can culminate in neurodegeneration. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which demyelination and loss of oligodendrocytes compromise axons. We highlight the intra-axonal cascades initiated by demyelination that can result in irreversible axonal damage. Both the restoration of oligodendrocyte myelination or neuroprotective therapies targeting these intra-axonal cascades are likely to have therapeutic potential in disorders in which oligodendrocyte support of axons is disrupted.},

D. Canollet al.,1996,Neuron17,229–243). We now show that GGF is able to induce differentiated oligodendrocytes to undergo a phenotypic reversion characterized by loss of MBP expression, reexpression of the intermediate filament protein nestin, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and a dramatic reduction in the number of processes per cell. TUNEL analysis demonstrates that GGF is not cytotoxic for mature oligodendrocytes, but rather enhances their survival. GGF also induces the rapid activation of the PI 3-kinase and MAP kinase signaling pathways. These results further support a role for the NRGs in promoting the proliferation and survival of and inhibiting the differentiation of cells in the oligodendrocyte lineage and demonstrate that oligodendrocytes that differentiate in culture retain a substantial degree of phenotypic plasticity.},

The potential for remyelination of the adult central nervous system (CNS) has been well-established. However, there is still some dispute whether remyelinating oligodendrocytes arise from dedifferentiation and/or proliferation of mature oligodendrocytes, or are generated solely from proliferation and differentiation of glial progenitor cells. This review focuses on studies carried out on remyelinating lesions in the adult rat spinal cord produced by injection of antibodies to galactocerebroside and serum complement that show: (1) oligodendrocytes which survive within an area of demyelination do not contribute to remyelination, (2) remyelination is carried out by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, (3) recruitment of oligodendrocyte progenitors to an area of demyelination is a local response, and (4) division of oligodendrocyte progenitors is symmetrical, resulting in chronic depletion of the oligodendrocyte progenitor population in the normal white matter around an area of remyelination. Such results suggest that repeated episodes of demyelination could lead to a failure of remyelination due to a depletion of oligodendrocyte progenitors.},

	abstract = {Background
Multiple sclerosis is a degenerative inflammatory disease of the CNS characterised by immune-mediated destruction of myelin and progressive neuroaxonal loss. Myelin in the CNS is a specialised extension of the oligodendrocyte plasma membrane and clemastine fumarate can stimulate differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells in vitro, in animal models, and in human cells. We aimed to analyse the efficacy and safety of clemastine fumarate as a treatment for patients with multiple sclerosis.
Methods
We did this single-centre, 150-day, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover trial (ReBUILD) in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis with chronic demyelinating optic neuropathy on stable immunomodulatory therapy. Patients who fulfilled international panel criteria for diagnosis with disease duration of less than 15 years were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via block randomisation using a random number generator to receive either clemastine fumarate (5·36 mg orally twice daily) for 90 days followed by placebo for 60 days (group 1), or placebo for 90 days followed by clemastine fumarate (5·36 mg orally twice daily) for 60 days (group 2). The primary outcome was shortening of P100 latency delay on full-field, pattern-reversal, visual-evoked potentials. We analysed by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02040298.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 2014, and April 11, 2015, we randomly assigned 50 patients to group 1 (n=25) or group 2 (n=25). All patients completed the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was met with clemastine fumarate treatment, which reduced the latency delay by 1·7 ms/eye (95\% CI 0·5–2·9; p=0·0048) when analysing the trial as a crossover. Clemastine fumarate treatment was associated with fatigue, but no serious adverse events were reported.
Interpretation
To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial to document efficacy of a remyelinating drug for the treatment of chronic demyelinating injury in multiple sclerosis. Our findings suggest that myelin repair can be achieved even following prolonged damage.

Multipotent precursor cells are present in the CNS of adult as well as embryonic and neonatal animals and can differentiate into lineage-restricted progenitors such as oligodendroglial progenitors (OPs). The OPs present in adults have a different phenotype from those seen in earlier life, and their potential role in CNS repair remains unknown. To gain insights into the potential to manipulate the myelinating capacity of these precursor and/or progenitor cells, we generated a homogenous culture of OPs from neural precursor cells isolated from adult rat subependymal tissues. Phenotypic characterization indicated that these OPs resembled neonatal rather than adult OPs and produced robust myelin after transplantation. The ability to generate such cells from the adult brain therefore opens an avenue to explore the potential of these cells for repairing myelin disorders in adulthood.},

We used dual-color fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to extract OPCs from 21- to 23-week-old fetal human forebrain, and A2B5 selection to extract these cells from adult white matter. When xenografted to the forebrains of newborn shiverer mice, fetal OPCs dispersed throughout the white matter and developed into oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. By 12 weeks, the host brains showed extensive myelin production, compaction and axonal myelination. Isolates of OPCs derived from adult human white matter also myelinated shiverer mouse brain, but much more rapidly than their fetal counterparts, achieving widespread and dense myelin basic protein (MBP) expression by 4 weeks after grafting. Adult OPCs generated oligodendrocytes more efficiently than fetal OPCs, and ensheathed more host axons per donor cell than fetal cells. Both fetal and adult OPC phenotypes mediated the extensive and robust myelination of congenitally dysmyelinated host brain, although their differences suggested their use for different disease targets.},

Here, we generated PDGFαR-CreER transgenic mice and followed their fate in vivo in the developing and adult CNS. These studies revealed that NG2+ cells in the postnatal CNS generate myelinating oligodendrocytes, but not astrocytes or neurons. In regions of neurodegeneration in the spinal cord of ALS mice, NG2+ cells exhibited enhanced proliferation and accelerated differentiation into oligodendrocytes, but remained committed to the oligodendrocyte lineage. These results indicate that NG2+ cells in the normal CNS are oligodendrocyte precursors with restricted lineage potential, and that cell loss and gliosis are not sufficient to alter the lineage potential of these progenitors in ALS mice.},

Conditional deletion of Myelin regulatory factor (Myrf) in oligodendrocyte precursors blocked formation of new Enpp6+ oligodendrocytes and impaired learning within the same {\textasciitilde}2-3 hour time frame.

Oligodendrocytes in the CNS myelinate some axons, but not others, and do not myelinate structures including cell bodies and dendrites [1]. Recent studies indicate that extrinsic signals, such as neuronal activity [2, 3] and cell adhesion molecules [4], can bias myelination toward some axons and away from cell bodies and dendrites, indicating that, in vivo, neuronal and axonal cues regulate myelin targeting. In vitro, however, oligodendrocytes have an intrinsic propensity to myelinate [5, 6, 7] and can promiscuously wrap inert synthetic structures resembling neuronal processes [8, 9] or cell bodies [4]. A current therapeutic goal for the treatment of demyelinating diseases is to greatly promote oligodendrogenesis [10, 11, 12, 13]; thus, it is important to test how accurately extrinsic signals regulate the oligodendrocyte’s intrinsic program of myelination in vivo. Here, we test the hypothesis that neurons regulate myelination with sufficient stringency to always ensure correct targeting. Surprisingly, however, we find that myelin targeting in vivo is not very stringent and that mistargeting occurs readily when oligodendrocyte and myelin supply exceed axonal demand. We find that myelin is mistargeted to neuronal cell bodies in zebrafish mutants with fewer axons and independently in drug-treated zebrafish with increased oligodendrogenesis. Additionally, by increasing myelin production of oligodendrocytes in zebrafish and mice, we find that excess myelin is also inappropriately targeted to cell bodies. Our results suggest that balancing oligodendrocyte-intrinsic programs of myelin supply with axonal demand is essential for correct myelin targeting in vivo and highlight potential liabilities of strongly promoting oligodendrogenesis.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose
The phenothiazine derivative promethazine was first introduced into clinical practice as an antiallergic drug owing to its H1-receptor antagonizing properties. Nowadays, promethazine is primarily used as a sedative and/or as an antiemetic. The spectrum of clinically relevant effects is mediated by different molecular targets. Since glutamate is the predominant excitatory transmitter in the vertebrate brain and involved in alertness control, pain processing, and neurotoxicity we tested the hypothesis that promethazine interacts with excitatory ionotropic glutamate receptors.
Experimental approach
Electrophysiological experiments were performed by means of the patch-clamp technique at glutamate receptors heterologously expressed in human TsA cells.
Key results
Promethazine selectively inhibited NMDA receptors whereas AMPA- and kainate receptors were hardly affected. Inhibition of NMDA-induced membrane currents occurred in a reversible manner with a half-maximal effect at around 20 μM promethazine. The inhibition occurred in a non-competitive manner as it did neither vary with the glutamate nor the glycine concentration. Analysis of the underlying mechanism revealed only a weak dependency on receptor usage, pH value (pH 6.8–7.8), and membrane potential (zδ = 0.44 ± 0.04 according to the Woodhull-model). In line with the latter finding, promethazine did not interact with the Mg2+ binding site. However, the displacement of promethazine by 9-aminoacridine indicates that promethazine may interact with the channel pore more externally in relation to the Mg2+ binding site.
Conclusion and implications
Promethazine inhibits NMDA-mediated membrane currents in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner. The results presented here provide evidence that the NMDA receptor antagonism may contribute to clinically relevant effects of promethazine like sedation, analgesia or neuroprotection.},

	abstract = {Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative with antihistaminic (H1), sedative, antiemetic, anticholinergic, and antimotion sickness properties that can induce QT prolongation, which may lead to torsades de pointes. Since block of cardiac human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels is one of the leading causes of acquired long QT syndrome, we investigated the acute effects of promethazine on hERG channels to determine the electrophysiological basis for its proarrhythmic potential. Promethazine increased the action potential duration at 90\% of repolarization (APD90) in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 0.73 ␮M when action potentials were elicited under current clamp in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. We examined the effects of promethazine on the hERG channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes and HEK293 cells using two-microelectrode voltage-clamp and patch-clamp techniques. Promethazine induced a concentration-dependent decrease of the current amplitude at the end of the voltage steps and hERG tail currents. The IC50 of promethazine dependent hERG block in Xenopus oocytes decreased progressively relative to the degree of depolarization. The IC50 for the promethazine-induced block of the hERG currents in HEK293 cells at 36 ◦C was 1.46 ␮M at +20 mV. Promethazine affected the channels in the activated and inactivated states but not in the closed states. The S6 domain mutations, Y652A and F656A partially attenuated (Y652A) or abolished (F656A) the hERG current block. These results suggest that promethazine is a blocker of the hERG channels, providing a molecular mechanism for the arrhythmogenic side effects during the clinical administration of promethazine.},

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical effects of promethazine in overdose and explore the relationship between delirium and possible predictor variables.Methods: A case series of promethazine poisonings was identified from a prospective database of poisoning admissions to a regional toxicology service. Data were extracted including demographics, details of ingestion, clinical features including delirium, complications and medical outcomes. In addition to descriptive statistics, a fully Bayesian approach using logistic regression was undertaken to investigate the relationship between predictor variables and delirium.Results: There were 199 patients with 237 presentations, including 57 patients with 78 promethazine alone overdoses. Of these 57 patients who ingested promethazine alone the median age was 22 years [interquartile range (IQR): 17–31] and 42 were female (74\%). The median dose ingested was 625 mg (IQR: 350–1250 mg). Median length of stay was 19 h (IQR: 13–27 h), ten were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and four were ventilated. Delirium occurred in 33 patients (42\%), tachycardia (HR\&gt;100) occurred on 44 occasions (56\%) and hypotension only twice. There were no seizures, dysrhythmias or deaths. Multivariate analysis of 215 presentations (in 181 patients) where dose of promethazine ingested was known demonstrated that dose, administration of charcoal within 2 h and co-ingestants predicted whether patients developed delirium. No relationship was shown for sex and age. A plot of probability that a patient will develop delirium vs. dose was constructed which showed the probability of delirium for 250 mg was 31\%, 500 mg was 42\% and for 1 g was 55\% for promethazine alone overdoses.Conclusion: The main feature of promethazine toxicity is delirium, the probability of which can be predicted from the dose ingested. The administration of charcoal and the presence of co-ingestants appears to reduce the probability of delirium in a predictable manner.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.neuropharm.2012.03.006},
	abstract = {Background and purpose
The phenothiazine derivative promethazine was first introduced into clinical practice as an antiallergic drug owing to its H1-receptor antagonizing properties. Nowadays, promethazine is primarily used as a sedative and/or as an antiemetic. The spectrum of clinically relevant effects is mediated by different molecular targets. Since glutamate is the predominant excitatory transmitter in the vertebrate brain and involved in alertness control, pain processing, and neurotoxicity we tested the hypothesis that promethazine interacts with excitatory ionotropic glutamate receptors.
Experimental approach
Electrophysiological experiments were performed by means of the patch-clamp technique at glutamate receptors heterologously expressed in human TsA cells.
Key results
Promethazine selectively inhibited NMDA receptors whereas AMPA- and kainate receptors were hardly affected. Inhibition of NMDA-induced membrane currents occurred in a reversible manner with a half-maximal effect at around 20 μM promethazine. The inhibition occurred in a non-competitive manner as it did neither vary with the glutamate nor the glycine concentration. Analysis of the underlying mechanism revealed only a weak dependency on receptor usage, pH value (pH 6.8–7.8), and membrane potential (zδ = 0.44 ± 0.04 according to the Woodhull-model). In line with the latter finding, promethazine did not interact with the Mg2+ binding site. However, the displacement of promethazine by 9-aminoacridine indicates that promethazine may interact with the channel pore more externally in relation to the Mg2+ binding site.
Conclusion and implications
Promethazine inhibits NMDA-mediated membrane currents in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner. The results presented here provide evidence that the NMDA receptor antagonism may contribute to clinically relevant effects of promethazine like sedation, analgesia or neuroprotection.},

	abstract = {Microbial-type rhodopsins are found in archaea, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes. Some of them represent membrane ion transport proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin, a light-driven proton pump, or channelrhodopsin-1 (ChR1), a recently identified light-gated proton channel from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. ChR1 and ChR2, a related microbial-type rhodopsin from C. reinhardtii, were shown to be involved in generation of photocurrents of this green alga. We demonstrate by functional expression, both in oocytes of Xenopus laevis and mammalian cells, that ChR2 is a directly light-switched cation-selective ion channel. This channel opens rapidly after absorption of a photon to generate a large permeability for monovalent and divalent cations. ChR2 desensitizes in continuous light to a smaller steady-state conductance. Recovery from desensitization is accelerated by extracellular H+ and negative membrane potential, whereas closing of the ChR2 ion channel is decelerated by intracellular H+. ChR2 is expressed mainly in C. reinhardtii under low-light conditions, suggesting involvement in photoreception in dark-adapted cells. The predicted seven-transmembrane α helices of ChR2 are characteristic for G protein-coupled receptors but reflect a different motif for a cation-selective ion channel. Finally, we demonstrate that ChR2 may be used to depolarize small or large cells, simply by illumination.},

	abstract = {The ability to stimulate mammalian cells with light has significantly changed our understanding of electrically excitable tissues in health and disease, paving the way toward various novel therapeutic applications. Here, we demonstrate the potential of optogenetic control in cardiac cells using a hybrid experimental/computational technique. Experimentally, we introduced channelrhodopsin-2 into undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells via a lentiviral vector, and sorted and expanded the genetically engineered cells. Via directed differentiation, we created channelrhodopsin-expressing cardiomyocytes, which we subjected to optical stimulation. To quantify the impact of photostimulation, we assessed electrical, biochemical, and mechanical signals using patch-clamping, multielectrode array recordings, and video microscopy. Computationally, we introduced channelrhodopsin-2 into a classic autorhythmic cardiac cell model via an additional photocurrent governed by a light-sensitive gating variable. Upon optical stimulation, the channel opens and allows sodium ions to enter the cell, inducing a fast upstroke of the transmembrane potential. We calibrated the channelrhodopsin-expressing cell model using single action potential readings for different photostimulation amplitudes, pulse widths, and frequencies. To illustrate the potential of the proposed approach, we virtually injected channelrhodopsin-expressing cells into different locations of a human heart, and explored its activation sequences upon optical stimulation. Our experimentally calibrated computational toolbox allows us to virtually probe landscapes of process parameters, and identify optimal photostimulation sequences toward pacing hearts with light.},

	abstract = {Background
Owing to the low therapeutic index of barbiturates, benzodiazepines (BZDs) became popular in this country and worldwide many decades ago for a wide range of conditions. Because of an increased understanding of pharmacology and physiology, the mechanisms of action of many BZDs are now largely understood, and BZDs of varying potency and duration of action have been developed and marketed. Although BZDs have many therapeutic roles and BZD-mediated effects are typically well tolerated in the general population, side effects and toxicity can result in morbidity and mortality for some patients. The elderly; certain subpopulations of patients with lung, liver, or kidney dysfunction; and patients on other classes of medication are especially prone to toxicity.

Methods
This review details the present knowledge about BZD mechanisms of action, drug profiles, clinical actions, and potential side effects. In addition, this review describes numerous types of BZD-mediated central nervous system effects.

Conclusion
For any patient taking a BZD, the prescribing physician must carefully evaluate the risks and benefits, and higher-risk patients require careful considerations. Clinically appropriate use of BZDs requires prudence and the understanding of pharmacology.},

	abstract = {Peripheral nerve injury can lead to remodeling of brain circuits, and this can cause chronification of pain. We have recently reported that male mice subjected to spared injury of the sciatic nerve undergo changes in the function of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that culminate in reduced output of layer 5 pyramidal cells. More recently, we have shown that this is mediated by alterations in synaptic inputs from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) into GABAergic interneurons in the mPFC. Optogenetic inhibition of these inputs reversed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in male mice. It is known that the processing of pain signals can exhibit marked sex differences. We therefore tested whether the dysregulation of BLA to mPFC signaling is equally altered in female mice. Injection of AAV-Arch3.0 constructs into the BLA followed by implantation of a fiberoptic cannula into the mPFC in sham and SNI operated female mice was carried out, and pain behavioral responses were measured in response to yellow light mediated activation of this inhibitory opsin. Our data reveal that Arch3.0 activation leads to a marked increase in paw withdrawal thresholds and latencies in response to mechanical and thermal stimuli, respectively. However, we did not observe nerve injury-induced changes in mPFC layer 5 pyramidal cell output in female mice. Hence, the observed light-induced analgesic effects may be due to compensation for dysregulated neuronal circuits downstream of the mPFC.},

We demonstrate that the viral expression of the hM4D receptor in small-diameter primary afferent nociceptor enables chemogenetic inhibition of mechanical and thermal nociception thresholds.

These molecules are microbial opsins, seven-transmembrane proteins adapted from organisms found throughout the world, which react to light by transporting ions across the lipid membranes of cells in which they are genetically expressed. These tools are enabling the causal assessment of the roles that different sets of neurons play within neural circuits, and are accordingly being used to reveal how different sets of neurons contribute to the emergent computational and behavioral functions of the brain. These tools are also being explored as components of prototype neural control prosthetics capable of correcting neural circuit computations that have gone awry in brain disorders.

	abstract = {Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) has quickly gained popularity as a powerful tool for eliciting genetically targeted neuronal activation. However, little has been reported on the response kinetics of optogenetic stimulation across different neuronal subtypes. With excess stimulation, neurons can be driven into depolarization block, a state where they cease to fire action potentials. Herein, we demonstrate that light-induced depolarization block in neurons expressing ChR2 poses experimental challenges for stable activation of specific cell types and may confound interpretation of experiments when ‘activated’ neurons are in fact being functionally silenced. We show both ex vivo and in vivo that certain neuronal subtypes targeted for ChR2 expression become increasingly susceptible to depolarization block as the duration of light pulses are increased. We find that interneuron populations have a greater susceptibility to this effect than principal excitatory neurons, which are more resistant to light-induced depolarization block. Our results highlight the need to empirically determine the photo-response properties of targeted neurons when using ChR2, particularly in studies designed to elicit complex circuit responses in vivo where neuronal activity will not be recorded simultaneous to light stimulation., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01481.001, The brain is a highly complex structure composed of trillions of interconnecting nerve cells. The pattern of connections between these cells gives rise to the various brain circuits that govern how the brain functions. Understanding how the brain is wired together is important for determining how ‘faulty circuits’ contribute to various neurological disorders., New optogenetic technique tools allow neuroscientists to turn on specific neurons simply by shining light on them. These techniques involve genetically manipulating the organisms so that their neurons express proteins that are activated when they are exposed to light of a particular wavelength. However, it is important to understand the limitations of this approach—including the possibility that the light might actually turn off some neurons—when using it to study animal behavior., Now, Herman, Huang et al. show that shining light pulses for long durations onto neurons expressing a light-activated protein called channelrhodopsin-2 causes the neurons to become silenced rather than activated. Moreover, certain types of neurons, called interneurons, are more susceptible to this effect—termed ‘depolarization block’—than the other types of neurons., Researchers need to be mindful of this effect when channelrhodopsin-2 is used in optogenetic experiments to study the behavior of living animals. However, this silencing property could be useful in experiments that investigate situations in which depolarization block is thought to contribute to brain function and health: such as in the treatments of schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease., DOI:

Optogenetics is a new and growing field that uses the combination of light and molecular genetics for the first time ever. This rare combination is used to control the activity of living cells by expressing photosensitive proteins to visualize signaling events and manipulate cell activity. The treatments for NP are limited and have hardly achieved the desirable efficacy. NP differs from other types of pain, such as nociceptive pain, in that the treatments for NP are far more complex and highly challenging for clinical practice. This review presents the background of optogenetics, current applications in various fields, and the findings of optogenetics in NP.

Taking advantage of a binary genetic approach, we selectively targeted Nav1.8(+) sensory neurons for conditional expression of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) channels. Acute blue light illumination of the skin produced robust nocifensive behaviors, evoked by the remote stimulation of both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptive fibers as indicated by c-Fos labeling in laminae I and II of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. A non-nociceptive component also contributes to the observed behaviors, as shown by c-Fos expression in lamina III of the dorsal horn and the expression of ChR2-EYFP in a subpopulation of large-diameter Nav1.8(+) dorsal root ganglion neurons. Selective activation of Nav1.8(+) afferents in vivo induced central sensitization and conditioned place aversion, thus providing a novel paradigm to investigate plasticity in the pain circuitry. Long-term potentiation was similarly evoked by light activation of the same afferents in isolated spinal cord preparations. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, the optical control of nociception and central sensitization in behaving mammals and enables selective activation of the same class of afferents in both in vivo and ex vivo preparations. Our results provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that optical dissection of the contribution of specific classes of afferents to central sensitization is possible. The high spatiotemporal precision offered by this non-invasive model will facilitate drug development and target validation for pain therapeutics.},

Inhibitory archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) proton pumps were delivered to Nav1.8+ primary afferents using the Nav1.8-Cre driver line. Arch expression covered both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors and yellow light stimulation reliably blocked electrically induced action potentials in DRG neurons. Acute transdermal illumination of the hindpaws of Nav1.8-Arch+ mice significantly reduced mechanical allodynia under inflammatory conditions, while basal mechanical sensitivity was not affected by the optical stimulation. Arch-driven hyperpolarization of nociceptive terminals was sufficient to prevent channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mediated mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in double-transgenic Nav1.8-ChR2+-Arch+ mice. Furthermore, prolonged optical silencing of peripheral afferents in anesthetized Nav1.8-Arch+ mice led to poststimulation analgesia with a significant decrease in mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity under inflammatory and neuropathic conditions. These findings highlight the role of peripheral neuronal inputs in the onset and maintenance of pain hypersensitivity, demonstrate the plasticity of pain pathways even after sensitization has occurred, and support the involvement of Nav1.8+ afferents in both inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Together, we present a selective analgesic approach in which genetically identified subsets of peripheral sensory fibers can be remotely and optically inhibited with high temporal resolution, overcoming the compensatory limitations of genetic ablations.},

	abstract = {Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage. The processing of pain involves complicated modulation at the levels of the periphery, spinal cord, and brain. The pathogenesis of chronic pain is still not fully understood, which makes the clinical treatment challenging. Optogenetics, which combines optical and genetic technologies, can precisely intervene in the activity of specific groups of neurons and elements of the related circuits. Taking advantage of optogenetics, researchers have achieved a body of new findings that shed light on the cellular and circuit mechanisms of pain transmission, pain modulation, and chronic pain both in the periphery and the central nervous system. In this review, we summarize recent findings in pain research using optogenetic approaches and discuss their significance in understanding the pathogenesis of chronic pain.},

Taking advantage of a binary genetic approach, we selectively targeted Nav1.8+ sensory neurons for conditional expression of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) channels. Acute blue light illumination of the skin produced robust nocifensive behaviors, evoked by the remote stimulation of both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptive fibers as indicated by c-Fos labeling in laminae I and II of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. A non-nociceptive component also contributes to the observed behaviors, as shown by c-Fos expression in lamina III of the dorsal horn and the expression of ChR2–EYFP in a subpopulation of large-diameter Nav1.8+ dorsal root ganglion neurons. Selective activation of Nav1.8+ afferents in vivo induced central sensitization and conditioned place aversion, thus providing a novel paradigm to investigate plasticity in the pain circuitry. Long-term potentiation was similarly evoked by light activation of the same afferents in isolated spinal cord preparations. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, the optical control of nociception and central sensitization in behaving mammals and enables selective activation of the same class of afferents in both in vivo and ex vivo preparations. Our results provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that optical dissection of the contribution of specific classes of afferents to central sensitization is possible. The high spatiotemporal precision offered by this non-invasive model will facilitate drug development and target validation for pain therapeutics.},

Here we use an optogenetic strategy to bidirectionally control nociceptors of non-transgenic mice. Intra-sciatic nerve injection of adeno-associated viruses encoding an excitatory opsin enabled light-inducible stimulation of acute pain, place aversion, and optogenetically mediated reductions in withdrawal thresholds to mechanical and thermal stimuli. In contrast, viral delivery of an inhibitory opsin enabled light-inducible inhibition of acute pain perception, and reversed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in a model of neuropathic pain. Light was delivered transdermally enabling these behaviors to be induced in freely moving animals. This approach may have utility in basic and translational pain research, and enable rapid drug screening and testing of newly engineered opsins.},

Light flashes cause a rapid transient shift of its absorption maximum from 560 to 415 nm. This shift is accompanied by release and uptake of protons. Respiring cells acidify the medium in the dark; if they contain purple membrane their O2 consumption is reduced in the light. Starved or anaerobic cells containing purple membrane, in the absence of any apparent source of energy, generate and maintain a proton gradient across the cell membrane as long as they are exposed to light. We postulate that the light-generated proton gradient arises from a vectorial release and uptake of protons by bacteriorhodopsin, which is suitably oriented in the cell membrane and under continuous illumination oscillates rapidly between the long- and short-wavelength form. Preliminary results indicate that the gradient in H. halobium plays the central role in energy coupling attributed to such electrochemical gradients by Mitchell's chemiosmotic theory.},

NpHR is compatible with ChR2, the previous optical excitation technology we have described, in that the two opposing probes operate at similar light powers but with well-separated action spectra. NpHR, like ChR2, functions in mammals without exogenous cofactors, and the two probes can be integrated with calcium imaging in mammalian brain tissue for bidirectional optical modulation and readout of neural activity. Likewise, NpHR and ChR2 can be targeted together to Caenorhabditis elegans muscle and cholinergic motor neurons to control locomotion bidirectionally.

Inhibitory archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) proton pumps were delivered to Nav1.8+ primary afferents using the Nav1.8-Cre driver line. Arch expression covered both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors and yellow light stimulation reliably blocked electrically induced action potentials in DRG neurons. Acute transdermal illumination of the hindpaws of Nav1.8-Arch+ mice significantly reduced mechanical allodynia under inflammatory conditions, while basal mechanical sensitivity was not affected by the optical stimulation. Arch-driven hyperpolarization of nociceptive terminals was sufficient to prevent channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mediated mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in double-transgenic Nav1.8-ChR2+-Arch+mice. Furthermore, prolonged optical silencing of peripheral afferents in anesthetized Nav1.8-Arch+ mice led to poststimulation analgesia with a significant decrease in mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity under inflammatory and neuropathic conditions. These findings highlight the role of peripheral neuronal inputs in the onset and maintenance of pain hypersensitivity, demonstrate the plasticity of pain pathways even after sensitization has occurred, and support the involvement of Nav1.8+ afferents in both inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Together, we present a selective analgesic approach in which genetically identified subsets of peripheral sensory fibers can be remotely and optically inhibited with high temporal resolution, overcoming the compensatory limitations of genetic ablations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) is a key brainstem structure that conveys powerful descending influence of the central pain-modulating system on spinal pain transmission and processing. Serotonergic (5-HT) neurons are a major component in the heterogeneous populations of RVM neurons and in the descending pathways from RVM. However, the descending influence of RVM 5-HT neurons on pain behaviors remains unclear.
RESULTS: In this study using optogenetic stimulation in tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2)- Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) transgenic mice, we determined the behavioral effects of selective activation of RVM 5-HT neurons on mechanical and thermal pain behaviors in vivo. We found that ChR2-EYFP-positive neurons strongly co-localized with TPH2-positive (5-HT) neurons in RVM. Optogenetic stimulation significantly increased c-fos expression in 5-HT cells in the RVM of TPH2-ChR2 mice, but not in wild type mice. Behaviorally, the optogenetic stimulation decreased both mechanical and thermal pain threshold in an intensity-dependent manner, with repeated stimulation producing sensitized pain behavior for up to two weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that selective activation of RVM 5-HT neurons exerts a predominant effect of pain facilitation under control conditions.},

Although the underlying pathophysiology is not well understood, inhibition of bladder sensory afferents temporarily relieves pain. Here, we explored the possibility that optogenetic inhibition of nociceptive sensory afferents could be used to modulate bladder pain. The light-activated inhibitory proton pump Archaerhodopsin (Arch) was expressed under control of the sensory neuron-specific sodium channel (sns) gene to selectively silence these neurons. Optically silencing nociceptive sensory afferents significantly blunted the evoked visceromotor response to bladder distension and led to small but significant changes in bladder function. To study of the role of nociceptive sensory afferents in freely behaving mice, we developed a fully implantable, flexible, wirelessly powered optoelectronic system for the long-term manipulation of bladder afferent expressed opsins. We found that optogenetic inhibition of nociceptive sensory afferents reduced both ongoing pain and evoked cutaneous hypersensitivity in the context of cystitis, but had no effect in uninjured, naïve mice. These results suggest that selective optogenetic silencing of nociceptive bladder afferents may represent a potential future therapeutic strategy for the treatment of bladder pain.},

Optogenetic tools enable cell selective and temporally precise control of neuronal activity; yet, difficulties in delivering sufficient light to the spinal cord of freely behaving animals have hampered the use of spinal optogenetic approaches to produce analgesia. We describe an epidural optic fiber designed for chronic spinal optogenetics that enables the precise delivery of light at multiple wavelengths to the spinal cord dorsal horn and sensory afferents.

Results
The epidural delivery of light enabled the optogenetic modulation of nociceptive processes at the spinal level. The acute and repeated activation of channelrhodopsin-2 expressing nociceptive afferents produced robust nocifensive behavior and mechanical sensitization in freely behaving mice, respectively. The optogenetic inhibition of GABAergic interneurons in the spinal cord dorsal horn through the activation of archaerhodopsin also produced a transient, but selective induction of mechanical hypersensitivity. Finally, we demonstrate the capacity of optogenetics to produce analgesia in freely behaving mice through the inhibition of nociceptive afferents via archaerhodopsin.

Conclusion
Epidural optogenetics provides a robust and powerful solution for activation of both excitatory and inhibitory opsins in sensory processing pathways. Our results demonstrate the potential of spinal optogenetics to modulate sensory behavior and produce analgesia in freely behaving animals.},

Mice in which TrkB-Cre-expressing neurons are ablated are less sensitive to the lightest touch under basal conditions, and fail to develop mechanical allodynia in a model of neuropathic pain. Moreover, selective optogenetic activation of these neurons after nerve injury evokes marked nociceptive behavior. Using a phototherapeutic approach based upon BDNF, the ligand for TrkB, we perform molecule-guided laser ablation of these neurons and achieve long-term retraction of TrkB-positive neurons from the skin and pronounced reversal of mechanical allodynia across multiple types of neuropathic pain.

These early RET+ dDH neurons receive excitatory as well as polysynaptic inhibitory inputs from touch- and/or pain-sensing afferents. In addition, they negatively regulate DH pain and touch pathways through both pre- and postsynaptic inhibition. Finally, specific ablation of early RET+ dDH neurons increases basal and chronic pain, whereas their acute activation reduces basal pain perception and relieves inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Taken together, our findings uncover a novel spinal circuit that mediates crosstalk between touch and pain pathways and suggest that some early RET+ dDH neurons could function as pain “gating” neurons.},

	abstract = {Most anuran larvae show large lateral oscillations at both the tip of the tail and the snout while swimming in a straight line. Although the lateral deflections at the snout have long been considered an inefficient aspect of tadpole locomotion, a recent hydrodynamic model suggests that they may in fact help generate thrust. It is not clear though exactly where this bending takes place. The vertebral column is extremely short and seemingly inflexible in anurans, and any axial flexion that might occur there is hidden within the globose body of the tadpole. Here we test the hypothesis that lateral deflections of the snout correlate with bending of the vertebral column within the torso of tadpoles. To quantify vertebral curvature, three sonomicrometry crystals were surgically implanted along the dorsal midline in locations corresponding to the anterior, middle, and posterior region of the presacral vertebral column. Swimming trials were conducted in a flume where synchronized video recordings were collected in dorsal view. Our results confirm that cyclic lateral bending occurs along the vertebral column during swimming and indicate that vertebral curvature is temporally in phase with lateral oscillation of the snout. Lateral oscillation of the snout increased significantly with increasing vertebral curvature. Similarly, tail beat amplitude also increases significantly with increasing vertebral curvature. Our results suggest that cyclic lateral flexion of the vertebral column, activated by the axial muscle within the torso of tadpoles contributes to snout oscillations and the generation of thrust during undulatory swimming in anuran larvae.},

These include the skin mechanosensory touch and pineal eye light-sensing pathways whose activation can initiate swimming, and the cement gland pressure-sensing pathway responsible for stopping swimming. A simple transection in the hindbrain can cut off the pineal eye and cement gland pathways from the swimming circuit in the spinal cord, resulting in losses of corresponding functions. Additionally, some pharmacological experiments targeting neurotransmission can be designed to affect swimming and, fluorescence-conjugated α–bungarotoxin can be used to label nicotinic receptors at neuromuscular junctions. These experiments can be readily adapted for undergraduate neuroscience teaching labs. Possible expansions of some experiments for more sophisticated pharmacological or neurophysiological labs are also discussed.},

We chose to study hatchling Xenopus tadpoles where behavior is controlled by a few thousand neurons but there is a very limited number of types of neuron. Young tadpoles can flex, swim away, adjust their trajectory, speed-up and slow-down, stop when they contact support and struggle when grasped. They are sensitive to touch, pressure, noxious stimuli, light intensity and water currents. Using whole-cell recording has led to rapid progress in understanding central networks controlling behavior. Our methods are illustrated by an analysis of the flexion reflex to skin touch. We then define the seven types of neuron that allow the tadpole to swim when the skin is touched and use paired recordings to investigate neuron properties, synaptic connections and activity patterns. Proposals on how the swim network operates are evaluated by experiment and network modeling. We then examine GABAergic inhibitory pathways that control swimming but also produce tonic inhibition to reduce responsiveness when the tadpole is at rest. Finally, we analyze the strong alternating struggling movements the tadpole makes when grasped. We show that the mechanisms for rhythm generation here are very different to those during swimming. Although much remains to be explained, study of this simple vertebrate has uncovered basic principles about the function and organization of vertebrate nervous systems.},

The CPG populations execute the selected action, generating output in motor neuron populations. Thus, the model describes a detailed and biologically plausible chain of information processing from external signals to sensors, sensory pathways, integration and decision-making, action selection and execution and finally, generation of appropriate motor activity and behaviour. We show how the model produces appropriate behaviours in response to a selected scenario, which consists of a sequence of “environmental” signals.

In this study we combined biochemical and fluorescence microscopy analyses to determine on a short time scale the fate of the strychnine-inactivated glycine receptor. Quantification of the cellular content of receptor showed that the rapid accumulation depends on protein synthesis. Cell surface biotinylation of neurons demonstrated that strychnine did not accelerate the turnover rate of the receptor. Labeling of endosomes indicated that, in strychnine-treated cells, the accumulated receptor is not blocked in the endosomal transport pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that strychnine does not destabilize the postsynaptic receptor but triggers its disappearance from synapses by a nondegradative sequestration of newly synthesized molecules in a nonendocytic compartment.},

	abstract = {Background
Although acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is not frequently used as a therapeutic agent in horses, its metabolite SA is of special interest in equestrianism since it is a natural component of many plants used as horse feed. This led to the establishment of thresholds by horse sport organizations for SA in urine and plasma. The aim of this study was to investigate plasma and urine concentrations of salicylic acid (SA) after oral administration of three different single dosages (12.5 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) to eight horses in a cross-over designed study.

Results
In the 12.5 mg/kg group, SA concentrations in urine peaked 2 h after oral administration (2675 μg/mL); plasma concentrations peaked at 1.5 h (17 μg/mL). In the 25 mg/kg group, maximum concentrations were detected after 2 h (urine, 2785 μg/mL) and 1.5 h (plasma, 23 μg/mL). In the 50 mg/kg group, maximum concentrations were observed after 5 h (urine, 3915 μg/mL) and 1.5 h (plasma, 45 μg/mL). The plasma half-life calculated for SA varied between 5.0 and 5.7 h. The urine concentration of SA fell below the threshold of 750 μg/mL (set by the International Equestrian Federation FEI and most of the horseracing authorities) between 7 and 26 h after administration of 12.5 and 25 mg/kg ASA and between 24 and 36 h after administration of 50 mg/kg ASA. For ASA, IC50 were 0.50 μg/mL (COX-1) and 5.14 μg/mL (COX-2). For salicylic acid, it was not possible to calculate an IC50 for either COX due to insufficient inhibition of both cyclooxygenases.

Conclusion
The established SA thresholds of 750 μg//mL urine and 6.5 μg/mL plasma appear too generous and are leaving space for misuse of the anti-inflammatory and analgetic compound ASA in horses.},

Urine alkalinization is indicated for various medical conditions. Alkalinization is usually achieved by intravenous administration of alkali substances titrated by repeated urinalyses. Some situations such as mass casualty events might require urine alkalinization by the oral route. We evaluated the efficacy of oral sodium bicarbonate administration for urine alkalinization.
Methods
In a prospective open-label trial, 4 g of sodium bicarbonate was administered orally 3 times daily to 9 healthy volunteers for 24 hours. Serial blood and urine samples were collected, and urine pH was evaluated. Plasma electrolytes and pH were also measured for safety purposes.
Results
All participants had a urine pH of at least 7 after 10 hours. At 20 hours, all participants had a urine pH of at least 8. No adverse effects or abnormal blood results were documented during the 24-hour follow-up.
Conclusions
Oral administration of a standard dose of sodium bicarbonate tablets resulted in effective urine alkalinization. Further research is needed to investigate the natural course of urine pH after cessation of our protocol and the efficacy of longer periods of treatment.},

Monitoring of salicylate and its metabolites is of toxicological, pharmacological and biomedical interest. Three capillary electrophoresis (CE) methods featuring alkaline aqueous buffers, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection and no solute extraction or derivatization have been explored. A competitive binding, electrokinetic capillary-based immunoassay is developed that recognizes the presence of salicylate and gentisic acid in urine. Differentiation of the two compounds, however, is problematic. With appropriate ultraviolet excitation, many salicylate-related compounds are fluorescent so that CE with direct urine injection and LIF detection permits the determination of salicylate, gentisic acid and salicyluric acid. Using a HeCd laser with 325 nm produces interference-free monitoring of all three compounds. Using 257 nm excitation from a frequency doubled Ar ion laser, native fluorescence of an endogenous urinary compound that co-migrates with gentisic acid is observed. With wavelength-resolved fluorescence detection, however, the two substances are distinguished. Furthermore, this technique, with comparison to literature data, permits the putative assignment of several peaks to other salicylate metabolites, namely glucuronide conjugates of salicylate and salicyluric acid. All three CE-LIF techniques have been applied to toxicological patient urines and urines collected after ingestion of 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. CE results compare favorably with those obtained by a commercial fluorescence polarization immunoassay and by a conventional photometric assay.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) includes the administration of aspirin. Current guidelines recommend chewing aspirin tablets to increase absorption. While this is intuitive, there are scant data supporting this recommendation. The purpose of this study is to assess which of 3 different aspirin formulations is most rapidly absorbed after ingestion.

Methods
A prospective, open-label, 3-way crossover volunteer study at a tertiary university medical center with human subjects 18 years or older. Fasted subjects were randomly assigned to receive aspirin 1,950 mg as (1) solid aspirin tablets swallowed whole, (2) solid aspirin tablet chewed then swallowed, or (3) a chewable aspirin formulation chewed and swallowed. Serum salicylate measurements were obtained over a period of 180 minutes. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined.

Results
Thirteen males and 1 female completed all 3 arms of study. Peak serum salicylate concentrations were seen at 180 minutes in all groups. Mean peaks were 10.4, 11.3, and 12.2 mg/dL in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Mean area under the time concentration was 1,153, 1,401, and 1,743 mg-min/dL in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. No measurable salicylate concentrations were seen in 6 subjects in group 1 at 60 minutes as compared to 1 subject in group 2. All subjects in group 3 had measurable levels at 45 minutes. There were no adverse effects in any of the subjects during the study period.

Conclusion
Our data demonstrate that the chewable aspirin formulation achieved the most rapid rate of absorption. In addition, the chewable formulation absorption was more complete than the other formulations at 180 minutes. These data suggest that in the treatment of ACS, a chewable aspirin formulation may be preferable to solid tablet aspirin, either chewed or swallowed.},

health. Therefore,
efforts have been made to develop new antibacterial agents that address
this critical medical issue. Gepotidacin is a novel, bactericidal,
first-in-class triazaacenaphthylene antibacterial in clinical development.
Recently, phase III clinical trials for gepotidacin treatment of uncomplicated
urinary tract infections caused by uropathogens, including Escherichia coli, were stopped for demonstrated efficacy.
Because of the clinical promise of gepotidacin, it is important to
understand how the compound interacts with its cellular targets, gyrase
and topoisomerase IV, from E. coli.
Consequently, we determined how gyrase and topoisomerase IV mutations
in amino acid residues that are involved in gepotidacin interactions
affect the susceptibility of E. coli cells to the compound and characterized the effects of gepotidacin
on the activities of purified wild-type and mutant gyrase and topoisomerase
IV. Gepotidacin displayed well-balanced dual-targeting of gyrase and
topoisomerase IV in E. coli cells,
which was reflected in a similar inhibition of the catalytic activities
of these enzymes by the compound. Gepotidacin induced gyrase/topoisomerase
IV-mediated single-stranded, but not double-stranded, DNA breaks.
Mutations in GyrA and ParC amino acid residues that interact with
gepotidacin altered the activity of the compound against the enzymes
and, when present in both gyrase and topoisomerase IV, reduced the
antibacterial activity of gepotidacin against this mutant strain.
Our studies provide insights regarding the well-balanced dual-targeting
of gyrase and topoisomerase IV by gepotidacin in E.
coli.},

Without early treatment, inhalation of anthrax spores with progression to inhalational anthrax disease is associated with high fatality rates. Gepotidacin is a novel first-in-class triazaacenaphthylene antibiotic that inhibits bacterial DNA replication by a distinct mechanism of action and is being evaluated for use against biothreat and conventional pathogens. Gepotidacin selectively inhibits bacterial DNA replication via a unique binding mode and has in vitro activity against a collection of B. anthracis isolates including antibacterial-resistant strains, with the MIC90 ranging from 0.5 to 1 µg/mL. In vivo activity of gepotidacin was also evaluated in the New Zealand White rabbit model of inhalational anthrax. The primary endpoint was survival, with survival duration and bacterial clearance as secondary endpoints. The trigger for treatment was the presence of anthrax protective antigen in serum. New Zealand White rabbits were dosed intravenously for 5 days with saline or gepotidacin at 114 mg/kg/d to simulate a dosing regimen of 1,000 mg intravenous (i.v.) three times a day (TID) in humans. Gepotidacin provided a survival benefit compared to saline control, with 91\% survival (P-value: 0.0001). All control animals succumbed to anthrax and were found to be blood- and organ culture-positive for B. anthracis. The novel mode of action, in vitro microbiology, preclinical safety, and animal model efficacy data, which were generated in line with Food and Drug Administration Animal Rule, support gepotidacin as a potential treatment for anthrax in an emergency biothreat situation.},

Healthy elderly participants received repeat 1500 mg gepotidacin twice daily with or without a moderate-fat meal. Primary end points were PKs (studies 1 and 2) and safety (studies 1 and 3 part 3). Gepotidacin PK parameters were comparable across all ages and were dose proportional. In all studies, gepotidacin was readily absorbed with median time to maximum concentration observed ranging from 1.0 to 4.0 h across all doses. Median apparent terminal phase half-life was consistent across studies and doses (range: 5.97–19.2 h). Steady-state was achieved following repeated dosing for 3–5 days; gepotidacin PK parameters were time invariant after repeated oral dosing. A moderate-fat meal did not affect gepotidacin PK parameters. Gepotidacin was generally well-tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events reported. Collectively, these PK and safety data across a wide range of doses in healthy participants aged greater than or equal to 18 years support the development of gepotidacin in further clinical studies.},

Type IIA topoisomerases cleave and religate DNA to regulate DNA topology and are a major class of antibacterial and anticancer drug targets, yet there is no well developed structural basis for understanding drug action. Here we report the 2.1 Å crystal structure of a potent, new class, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent in complex with Staphylococcus aureus DNA gyrase and DNA, showing a new mode of inhibition that circumvents fluoroquinolone resistance in this clinically important drug target. The inhibitor ‘bridges’ the DNA and a transient non-catalytic pocket on the two-fold axis at the GyrA dimer interface, and is close to the active sites and fluoroquinolone binding sites. In the inhibitor complex the active site seems poised to cleave the DNA, with a single metal ion observed between the TOPRIM (topoisomerase/primase) domain and the scissile phosphate. This work provides new insights into the mechanism of topoisomerase action and a platform for structure-based drug design of a new class of antibacterial agents against a clinically proven, but conformationally flexible, enzyme class.},

Broth microdilution was used to evaluate the MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) activity of gepotidacin and comparators against 25 N. gonorrhoeae strains (including five ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible strains). Gepotidacin activity was also evaluated against three N. gonorrhoeae strains (including a ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible strain) for resistance development, against three N. gonorrhoeae strains (including two tetracycline- and azithromycin-nonsusceptible strains) using time-kill kinetics and checkerboard methods, and against two N. gonorrhoeae strains for the investigation of postantibiotic (PAE) and subinhibitory (PAE-SME) effects. The MIC50 and MIC90 for gepotidacin against the 25 N. gonorrhoeae isolates tested were 0.12 and 0.25 μg/ml, respectively. The MBC50 and MBC90 for gepotidacin were 0.25 and 0.5 μg/ml, respectively. Gepotidacin was bactericidal, and single-step resistance selection studies did not recover any mutants, indicating a low rate of spontaneous single-step resistance. For combinations of gepotidacin and comparators tested using checkerboard methods, there were no instances where antagonism occurred and only one instance of synergy (with moxifloxacin; fractional inhibitory concentration, 0.375). This was not confirmed by in vitro time-kill studies. The PAE for gepotidacin against the wild-type strain ranged from 0.5 to {\textgreater}2.5 h, and the PAE-SME was {\textgreater}2.5 h. These in vitro data indicate that further study of gepotidacin is warranted for potential use in treating infections caused by N. gonorrhoeae.},

The compound has successfully completed phase II trials for the treatment of acute bacterial skin/skin structure infections and for the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea. It also displays robust in vitro activity against a range of wild-type and fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria. Due to the clinical promise of gepotidacin, a detailed understanding of its interactions with its antibacterial targets is essential. Thus, we characterized the mechanism of action of gepotidacin against Staphylococcus aureus gyrase. Gepotidacin was a potent inhibitor of gyrase-catalyzed DNA supercoiling (IC50 ≈ 0.047 μM) and relaxation of positively supercoiled substrates (IC50 ≈ 0.6 μM). Unlike fluoroquinolones, which induce primarily double-stranded DNA breaks, gepotidacin induced high levels of gyrase-mediated single-stranded breaks. No double-stranded breaks were observed even at high gepotidacin concentration, long cleavage times, or in the presence of ATP. Moreover, gepotidacin suppressed the formation of double-stranded breaks. Gepotidacin formed gyrase-DNA cleavage complexes that were stable for {\textgreater}4 h. In vitro competition suggests that gyrase binding by gepotidacin and fluoroquinolones are mutually exclusive. Finally, we determined crystal structures of gepotidacin with the S. aureus gyrase core fusion truncate with nicked (2.31 Å resolution) or with intact (uncleaved) DNA (2.37 Å resolution). In both cases, a single gepotidacin molecule was bound midway between the two scissile DNA bonds and in a pocket between the two GyrA subunits. A comparison of the two structures demonstrates conformational flexibility within the central linker of gepotidacin, which may contribute to the activity of the compound.,},

Unlike moxifloxacin, QPT-1 and etoposide interact with conserved GyrB TOPRIM residues rationalizing why QPT-1 can overcome fluoroquinolone resistance. Our data show etoposide’s antibacterial activity is due to DNA gyrase inhibition and suggests other anticancer agents act similarly. Analysis of multiple DNA gyrase co-crystal structures, including asymmetric cleavage complexes, led to a ‘pair of swing-doors’ hypothesis in which the movement of one DNA segment regulates cleavage and religation of the second DNA duplex. This mechanism can explain QPT-1’s bacterial specificity. Structure-based strategies for developing topo2A antibacterials are suggested.},

In the relative bioavailability study, after gepotidacin administration to 26 healthy adults as free-base roller-compacted (RC) tablets, free-base high-shear wet granulation (HSWG) tablets, and mesylate salt reference capsules, the RC tablet exposure ratios and 90\% confidence intervals (CIs) were within the 0.80-to-1.25 confidence bounds; however, the HSWG tablet maximum observed concentration (Cmax) was higher than the reference (ratio, 1.15; 90\% CI, 1.0113, 1.3047). In the healthy adult (n = 16) and adolescent (n = 17) study, a gepotidacin mesylate salt tablet was evaluated as a 1,500-mg single dose or 2 doses administered 6 or 12 h apart (6,000 mg total), or placebo was administered. The single-dose mean Cmax was ∼27\% higher in adolescents than in adults, and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values were comparable in both populations. After 2 doses were administered, the mean Cmax values were similar for both age groups, and the mean AUC was ∼35\% higher in adolescents than in adults. Concentrations increased proportionally with dose. Safety-risk profiles were similar for both age groups. Across studies, the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal. Overall, the pharmacokinetics of the final gepotidacin mesylate salt tablet have been well characterized, enrollment of adolescents into the pivotal trials is supported, and dosing intervals were determined that should provide adequate exposures for microbiological efficacy.

Here we report the 2.1 Å crystal structure of a potent, new class, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent in complex with Staphylococcus aureus DNA gyrase and DNA, showing a new mode of inhibition that circumvents fluoroquinolone resistance in this clinically important drug target. The inhibitor ‘bridges’ the DNA and a transient non-catalytic pocket on the two-fold axis at the GyrA dimer interface, and is close to the active sites and fluoroquinolone binding sites. In the inhibitor complex the active site seems poised to cleave the DNA, with a single metal ion observed between the TOPRIM (topoisomerase/primase) domain and the scissile phosphate.

Gepotidacin caused a mild effect on heart rate, with a largest placebo-corrected change-from-baseline heart rate of 7 and 10 beats per minute at the end of the 1,000-mg and 1,800-mg infusion, respectively. Gepotidacin caused an increase of change-from-baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF), with a peak effect at the end of infusion. The largest mean placebo-corrected ΔQTcF (ΔΔQTcF) was 12.1 ms (90\% confidence interval [CI], 9.5 to 14.8) and 22.2 ms (90\% CI, 19.6 to 24.9) after 1,000 mg and 1,800 mg, respectively. ΔΔQTcF rapidly fell after the end of the infusion, with a mean ΔΔQTcF of 6.1 ms 60 min after the 1,800-mg dose. Exposure-response analysis demonstrated a statistically significant positive relationship between gepotidacin plasma levels and ΔΔQTcF, with a slope of 1.45 ms per μg/ml (90\% CI, 1.30 to 1.61).

	abstract = {Introduction
Gonorrhea, caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), is the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI). Rates of antimicrobial resistance to standard care are increasing worldwide, with many antibiotic classes now ineffective against NG. Gepotidacin is a first-in-class, bactericidal, triazaacenaphthylene antibiotic that inhibits bacterial DNA replication by inhibition of two enzymes, where a single target-specific mutation does not significantly impact susceptibility. Gepotidacin confers activity against NG, including most strains resistant to marketed antibiotics. Here, we describe the design of a phase 3 clinical trial (EAGLE-1; NCT04010539) evaluating gepotidacin for the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea.

Methods
This phase 3, randomized, multicenter, sponsor-blinded, noninferiority study across six countries is comparing the efficacy of gepotidacin with ceftriaxone plus azithromycin in 400 patients with uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea (microbiological intent-to-treat population) and assessing the safety of gepotidacin in approximately 600 patients (intent-to-treat population). Eligible participants 12 years of age or older with clinical suspicion of urogenital gonococcal infection and a NG-positive urogenital sample and/or purulent discharge are randomized 1:1 to receive oral gepotidacin (2 × 3000 mg 10–12 h apart) or ceftriaxone (500 mg, intramuscular) plus azithromycin (1 g, oral). The primary endpoint is culture-confirmed bacterial eradication of NG from the urogenital site at the test-of-cure (days 4–8) visit.

Planned Outcomes
This trial was designed in accordance with US Food and Drug Administration (2015) and European Medicines Agency (2011) guidance, particularly the primary endpoint and microbiological evaluability requirements. This study will help characterize the risk–benefit profile of gepotidacin for treating uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea. Gepotidacin is an important potential treatment for gonorrhea to help address the urgent unmet need of multidrug resistance and the increasingly limited number of oral treatment options.

	abstract = {Gepotidacin is a first-in-class triazaacenaphthylene novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitor (NBTI). The compound has successfully completed phase II trials for the treatment of acute bacterial skin/skin structure infections and for the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea. It also displays robust in vitro activity against a range of wild-type and fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria. Due to the clinical promise of gepotidacin, a detailed understanding of its interactions with its antibacterial targets is essential. Thus, we characterized the mechanism of action of gepotidacin against Staphylococcus aureus gyrase. Gepotidacin was a potent inhibitor of gyrase-catalyzed DNA supercoiling (IC50 ≈ 0.047 μM) and relaxation of positively supercoiled substrates (IC50 ≈ 0.6 μM). Unlike fluoroquinolones, which induce primarily double-stranded DNA breaks, gepotidacin induced high levels of gyrase-mediated single-stranded breaks. No double-stranded breaks were observed even at high gepotidacin concentration, long cleavage times, or in the presence of ATP. Moreover, gepotidacin suppressed the formation of double-stranded breaks. Gepotidacin formed gyrase-DNA cleavage complexes that were stable for {\textgreater}4 h. In vitro competition suggests that gyrase binding by gepotidacin and fluoroquinolones are mutually exclusive. Finally, we determined crystal structures of gepotidacin with the S. aureus gyrase core fusion truncate with nicked (2.31 Å resolution) or with intact (uncleaved) DNA (2.37 Å resolution). In both cases, a single gepotidacin molecule was bound midway between the two scissile DNA bonds and in a pocket between the two GyrA subunits. A comparison of the two structures demonstrates conformational flexibility within the central linker of gepotidacin, which may contribute to the activity of the compound.,},

efforts have been made to develop new antibacterial agents that address
this critical medical issue. Gepotidacin is a novel, bactericidal,
first-in-class triazaacenaphthylene antibacterial in clinical development.
Recently, phase III clinical trials for gepotidacin treatment of uncomplicated
urinary tract infections caused by uropathogens, including Escherichia coli, were stopped for demonstrated efficacy.
Because of the clinical promise of gepotidacin, it is important to
understand how the compound interacts with its cellular targets, gyrase
and topoisomerase IV, from E. coli.
Consequently, we determined how gyrase and topoisomerase IV mutations
in amino acid residues that are involved in gepotidacin interactions
affect the susceptibility of E. coli cells to the compound and characterized the effects of gepotidacin
on the activities of purified wild-type and mutant gyrase and topoisomerase
IV. Gepotidacin displayed well-balanced dual-targeting of gyrase and
topoisomerase IV in E. coli cells,
which was reflected in a similar inhibition of the catalytic activities
of these enzymes by the compound. Gepotidacin induced gyrase/topoisomerase
IV-mediated single-stranded, but not double-stranded, DNA breaks.
Mutations in GyrA and ParC amino acid residues that interact with
gepotidacin altered the activity of the compound against the enzymes
and, when present in both gyrase and topoisomerase IV, reduced the
antibacterial activity of gepotidacin against this mutant strain.
Our studies provide insights regarding the well-balanced dual-targeting

Pathogenic Escherichia coli are listed among the most critical group of bacteria that require fast development of new antibiotics and innovative treatment strategies. Among harmful extraintestinal Enterobacteriaceae strains, uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) pose a significant health threat. UPEC are considered the major causative factor of urinary tract infection (UTI), the second-most commonly diagnosed infectious disease in humans worldwide. UTI treatment places a substantial financial burden on healthcare systems. Most importantly, the misuse of antibiotics during treatment has caused selection of strains with the ability to acquire MDR via miscellaneous mechanisms resulting in gaining resistance against many commonly prescribed antibiotics like ampicillin, gentamicin, cotrimoxazole and quinolones. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as transposons, integrons and conjugative plasmids are the major drivers in spreading resistance genes in UPEC. The co-occurrence of various bacterial evasion strategies involving MGEs and the SOS stress response system requires further research and can potentially lead to the discovery of new, much-awaited therapeutic targets. Here, we analyzed and summarized recent discoveries regarding the role, mechanisms, and perspectives of MDR in the pathogenicity of UPEC.},

	abstract = {Multitargeting antibiotics, i.e., single compounds capable of inhibiting two or more bacterial targets, are generally considered to be a promising therapeutic strategy against resistance evolution. The rationale for this theory is that multitargeting antibiotics demand the simultaneous acquisition of multiple mutations at their respective target genes to achieve significant resistance. The theory presumes that individual mutations provide little or no benefit to the bacterial host. Here, we propose that such individual stepping-stone mutations can be prevalent in clinical bacterial isolates, as they provide significant resistance to other antimicrobial agents. To test this possibility, we focused on gepotidacin, an antibiotic candidate that selectively inhibits both bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. In a susceptible organism, Klebsiella pneumoniae, a combination of two specific mutations in these target proteins provide an {\textgreater}2,000-fold reduction in susceptibility, while individually, none of these mutations affect resistance significantly. Alarmingly, strains with decreased susceptibility against gepotidacin are found to be as virulent as the wild-type Klebsiella pneumoniae strain in a murine model. Moreover, numerous pathogenic isolates carry mutations which could promote the evolution of clinically significant reduction of susceptibility against gepotidacin in the future. As might be expected, prolonged exposure to ciprofloxacin, a clinically widely employed gyrase inhibitor, coselected for reduced susceptibility against gepotidacin. We conclude that extensive antibiotic usage could select for mutations that serve as stepping-stones toward resistance against antimicrobial compounds still under development. Our research indicates that even balanced multitargeting antibiotics are prone to resistance evolution.},

The metabolism and disposition in healthy human subjects was investigated. 2. Six male subjects received [14C] GSK2140944 orally (2000 mg) and as a single 2-hour i.v. infusion (1000 mg). Urinary elimination (59\%) was major by the i.v. route, whereas fecal elimination (53\%) pre-dominated via the oral route. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) was used for the analysis of plasma and bile samples due to the low level of radioactivity in samples (low specific activity of the doses). Unchanged GSK2140944 was the predominant circulating component ({\textgreater}60\% DRM), with the main circulating metabolite M4 formed by oxidation of the triazaacenaphthylene moiety representing 10.8\% (considered major) and 8.6\% drug-related material by the oral and i.v. route, respectively. Approximately 50\% of the oral dose was absorbed and eliminated mainly as unchanged GSK2140944 in urine (∼20\% of dose). Elimination via metabolism (∼13\% of dose) was relatively minor. The facile oxidation of GSK2140944 to metabolite M4 was believed to be a result of activation by adjacent electron withdrawing groups. 3. This study demonstrates the use of AMS to overcome radioprofiling challenges presented by low specific activity resulted from high doses administration.},

	abstract = {Aims/hypothesis Variants of UCP2 and UCP3 genes have been reported to be associated with obesity, but the available data on the relationship are inconsistent. A meta-analysis was performed to determine whether there are any associations between the UCP2 -866G/A, Ala55Val, and UCP3 -55C/T polymorphisms and obesity susceptibility. Methods The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and CNKI, CBMdisc databases were searched for all relevant case-control studies. The fixed or random effect pooled measure was determined on the bias of heterogeneity test among studies. Publication bias was examined by the modified Begg's and Egger's test. Results Twenty-two published articles with thirty-two outcomes were included in the meta-analysis: 12 studies with a total of 7,390 cases and 9,860 controls were analyzed for UCP2 -866G/A polymorphism with obesity, 9 studies with 1,483 cases and 2,067 controls for UCP2 Ala55Val and 8 studies with 2,180 cases and 2,514 controls for UCP3 -55C/T polymorphism. Using an additive model, the UCP2 -866G/A polymorphism showed no significant association with obesity risk in Asians (REM OR = 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.65–1.01). In contrast, a statistically significant association was observed in subjects of European descent (FEM OR = 1.06, 95\% CI: 1.01–1.12). But neither the UCP2 Ala55Val nor the UCP3 -55C/T polymorphism showed any significant association with obesity risk in either subjects of Asian (REM OR = 0.84, 95\% CI: 0.67–1.06 for Ala55Val; REM OR = 0.94, 95\% CI: 0.55–1.28 for -55C/T) or of European descent (REM OR = 1.04, 95\% CI: 0.80-1.36 for Ala55Val; FEM OR = 1.08, 95\% CI: 0.97–1.20 for -55C/T). Conclusions and Interpretation Our meta-analysis revealed that the UCP2 -866G/A polymorphism may be a risk factor for susceptibility to obesity in subjects of European descent, but not in individuals of Asian descent. And our results did not support the association between UCP2 Ala55Val, UCP3 -55C/T polymorphisms and obesity in the populations investigated. This conclusion warrants confirmation by further studies.},

By 2022, genomic studies led to the identification of almost 300 obesity-associated variants that could help to fill the gap of the high heritability rates. The endocannabinoid system is a critical regulator of metabolism for its effects on the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is a key enzyme in the inactivation of one of the two endocannabinoids, anandamide, and of its congeners. The rs324420 variant within the FAAH gene is a nucleotide missense change at position 385 from cytosine to adenine, resulting in a non-synonymous amino acid substitution from proline to threonine in the FAAH enzyme. This change increases sensitivity to proteolytic degradation, leading to reduced FAAH levels and increased levels of anandamide, associated with obesity-related traits. However, association studies of this variant with metabolic parameters have found conflicting results. This work aims to perform a systematic review of the existing literature on the association of the rs324420 variant in the FAAH gene with obesity and its related traits.},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review
The prevalence of obesity continues to rise steadily. While obesity management typically relies on dietary and lifestyle modifications, individual responses to these interventions vary widely. Clinical guidelines for overweight and obesity stress the importance of personalized approaches to care. This review aims to underscore the role of precision nutrition in delivering tailored interventions for obesity management.

Recent Findings
Recent technological strides have expanded our ability to detect obesity-related genetic polymorphisms, with machine learning algorithms proving pivotal in analyzing intricate genomic data. Machine learning algorithms can also predict postprandial glucose, triglyceride, and insulin levels, facilitating customized dietary interventions and ultimately leading to successful weight loss. Additionally, given that adherence to dietary recommendations is one of the key predictors of weight loss success, employing more objective methods for dietary assessment and monitoring can enhance sustained long-term compliance.

Summary
Biomarkers of food intake hold promise for a more objective dietary assessment. Acknowledging the multifaceted nature of obesity, precision nutrition stands poised to transform obesity management by tailoring dietary interventions to individuals' genetic backgrounds, gut microbiota, metabolic profiles, and behavioral patterns. However, there is insufficient evidence demonstrating the superiority of precision nutrition over traditional dietary recommendations. The integration of precision nutrition into routine clinical practice requires further validation through randomized controlled trials and the accumulation of a larger body of evidence to strengthen its foundation.},

With the upgrading of gene screening methods and the development of human genome project, whole genome scanning has been widely used to screen genes related to MAFLD, and more and more genetic variation factors related to MAFLD susceptibility have been discovered. There are genetic variants that are highly correlated with the occurrence and development of MAFLD, and there are genetic variants that are protective of MAFLD. These genetic variants affect the development of MAFLD by influencing lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. Therefore, in-depth analysis of different mechanisms of genetic variation and targeting of specific genetic variation genes may provide a new idea for the early prediction and diagnosis of diseases and individualized precision therapy, which may be a promising strategy for the treatment of MAFLD.},

	abstract = {Brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation is an emerging target for obesity treatments due to its thermogenic properties stemming from its ability to shuttle energy through uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1). Recent rodent studies show how BAT and white adipose tissue (WAT) activity can be modulated to increase the expression of thermogenic proteins. Consequently, these alterations enable organisms to endure cold-temperatures and elevate energy expenditure, thereby promoting weight loss. In humans, BAT is less abundant in obese subjects and impacts of thermogenesis are less pronounced, bringing into question whether energy expending properties of BAT seen in rodents can be translated to human models. Our review will discuss pharmacological, hormonal, bioactive, sex-specific and environmental activators and inhibitors of BAT to determine the potential for BAT to act as a therapeutic strategy. We aim to address the feasibility of utilizing BAT modulators for weight reduction in obese individuals, as recent studies suggest that BAT’s contributions to energy expenditure along with Ucp1-dependent and -independent pathways may or may not rectify energy imbalance characteristic of obesity.},

Insulin resistance due to lipotoxicity indirectly lead to reproductive system disorders, like polycystic ovary syndrome. Lipotoxicity has roles in insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. Increased circulating levels of lipids and the metabolic alterations in fatty acid utilization and intracellular signaling have been related to insulin resistance in muscle and liver. Different pathways, like novel protein kinase c pathways and the JNK-1 pathway, are involved as the mechanisms of how lipotoxicity leads to insulin resistance in nonadipose tissue organs, such as liver and muscle. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Endoplasmic reticulum stress, through mainly increased oxidative stress, also plays an important role in the etiology of insulin resistance, especially seen in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

	abstract = {Lipidomics has unveiled the intricate human lipidome, emphasizing the extensive diversity within lipid classes in mammalian tissues critical for cellular functions. This diversity poses a challenge in maintaining a delicate balance between adaptability to recurring physiological changes and overall stability. Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), linked to factors such as obesity and diabetes, stems from a compromise in the structural and functional stability of the liver within the complexities of lipid metabolism. This compromise inaccurately senses an increase in energy status, such as during fasting-feeding cycles or an upsurge in lipogenesis. Serum lipidomic studies have delineated three distinct metabolic phenotypes, or “metabotypes” in MASLD. MASLD-A is characterized by lower very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion and triglyceride (TG) levels, associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In contrast, MASLD-C exhibits increased VLDL secretion and TG levels, correlating with elevated CVD risk. An intermediate subtype, with a blend of features, is designated as the MASLD-B metabotype. In this perspective, we examine into recent findings that show the multifaceted regulation of VLDL secretion by S-adenosylmethionine, the primary cellular methyl donor. Furthermore, we explore the differential CVD and hepatic cancer risk across MASLD metabotypes and discuss the context and potential paths forward to gear the findings from genetic studies towards a better understanding of the observed heterogeneity in MASLD.},

	abstract = {The rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a top public health concern. The drivers of AMR are complex, with antimicrobial misuse, lack of coordinated policies and inter-country data cooperation playing key roles. The growing burden of AMR is not shared proportionally across countries and there’s marked heterogeneity of national-level policies to tackle AMR. Our aim was to evaluate whether stronger national policies correlate with reduced burden 3rd generation cephalosporin (3GC) resistant Escherichia coli utilizing two recently published estimates.We used 2019 estimates of deaths and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) due to 3GC resistant E. coli published by Murray et al. We matched these estimates to the governance score produced by Patel et al, which analyzed National Action Plans (NAP) through a governance framework, assigning a “governance score” to countries based on 54 indicators across 3 domains (Table 1). We describe the relationship between the burden of 3GC resistant E. coli and governance score across six WHO regions: Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, and Western Pacific.A total of 114 countries with both governance score and 3GC resistant E. coli data available were included. A multivariate log-linear regression model adjusted for region showed a relative risk reduction in the mortality of 3GC resistant E. coli of 2.8\% (CI 1\% –4.6\%; p-value 0.002) for every increase in point of governance score (Figure 1).When looking at DALYs as a measure of AMR burden, using a multivariate log-linear regression model adjusted for regions, we find a relative risk reduction of 4.7\% (CI 1.8\% - 6.2\%; P value \&lt; 0.001) for every increase in point of governance score (Figure 2).We show that countries with high governance scores had overall lower burden of 3GC resistant E. coli. Additional time series analysis as well as evaluating specific aspects of NAPs against AMR burden would be an important next step.All Authors: No reported disclosures},

Human infections with fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter species have become increasingly common and are associated with consumption of poultry. These findings, along with other data, prompted the US Food and Drug Administration to propose the withdrawal of fluoroquinolone use in poultry in 2000. A lengthy legal hearing concluded with an order to withdraw enrofloxacin from use in poultry (effective in September 2005). Clinicians are likely to continue to encounter patients with fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter infection and other enteric infection because of the continued circulation of fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter species in poultry flocks and in persons returning from foreign travel who have acquired a fluoroquinolone-resistant enteric infection while abroad.

PreXDR-TB and XDR-TB patients were treated with 24 weeks of bedaquiline within an optimised, individualised background regimen that could include levofloxacin, linezolid and clofazimine as needed. 200 patients were enrolled: 87 (43.9\%) had XDR-TB, 99 (49.3\%) were female and the median age was 34 years (interquartile range (IQR) 27–42). 134 (67.0\%) were living with HIV; the median CD4+ count was 281 cells·μL−1 (IQR 130–467) and all were on antiretroviral therapy.
16 out of 200 patients (8.0\%) did not complete 6 months of bedaquiline: eight were lost to follow-up, six died, one stopped owing to side effects and one was diagnosed with drug-sensitive TB. 146 out of 200 patients (73.0\%) had favourable outcomes: 139 (69.5\%) were cured and seven (3.5\%) completed treatment. 25 patients (12.5\%) died, 20 (10.0\%) were lost from treatment and nine (4.5\%) had treatment failure. 22 adverse events were attributed to bedaquiline, including a QT interval corrected using the Fridericia formula (QTcF) {\textgreater}500 ms (n=5), QTcF increase {\textgreater}50 ms from baseline (n=11) and paroxysmal atrial flutter (n=1).
Bedaquiline added to an optimised background regimen was associated with a high rate of successful treatment outcomes for this preXDR-TB and XDR-TB cohort.

We performed a systematic review by a meta-analysis; literature searches identified 16 studies. Our results showed that rs738409 exerted a strong influence not only on liver fat accumulation (GG homozygous showed 73\% higher lipid fat content when compared with CC ones, data from 2,937 subjects; P {\textless} 1 × 10−9), but also on the susceptibility of a more aggressive disease (GG homozygous had 3.24-fold greater risk of higher necroinflammatory scores and 3.2-fold greater risk of developing fibrosis when compared with CC homozygous; P {\textless} 1 × 10−9; data from 1,739 and 2,251 individuals, respectively). Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was more frequently observed in GG than CC homozygous (odds ratio [OR] 3.488, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.859-6.545, random model; P {\textless} 2 × 10−4; data from 2,124 patients). Evaluation of the risk associated with heterozygosity for the variant suggests that the additive genetic model best explains the effect of rs738409 on the susceptibility to develop NAFLD. Nevertheless, carrying two G alleles does not seem to increase the risk of severe histological features. Meta-regression showed a negative correlation between male sex and the effect of rs738409 on liver fat content (slope: −2.45 ± 1.04; P {\textless} 0.02). The rs738409 GG genotype versus the CC genotype was associated with a 28\% increase in serum alanine aminotransferase levels. Conclusion: By summarizing the amount of evidence, this study provided unequivocal evidence of rs738409 as a strong modifier of the natural history of NAFLD in different populations around the world.

Methods: We genotyped both variants in 143 individuals with NAFLD (55 females, age 18-74 years) and 180 controls (85 females, age 33-66 years). Liver steatosis was assessed using the ultrasound-based Hamaguchi score. A 4-month dietetic intervention, consisting of restriction of daily caloric intake without changes in physical activity, was performed. Results: Both PNPLA3 (p = 0.002) and TM6SF2 (p = 0.041) variants were associated with NAFLD before intervention. Overall, 88 patients completed the intervention, which led to a significant decrease of steatosis, ALT activities, body mass index, hip and waist circumferences, and waist-hip ratio (all p \&lt; 0.0001). Hepatic steatosis and anthropometric traits improved significantly (p \&lt; 0.05) in carriers of either PNPLA3 or TM6SF2 risk genotype. The improvement of phenotypic traits, apart from WHR (p = 0.02), was not modified by the presence of PNPLA3 or TM6SF2 variants. Conclusions: The PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 polymorphisms are associated with NAFLD assessed by the Hamaguchi score. Neither PNPLA3 nor TM6SF2 risk alleles impair the response to dietetic intervention in NAFLD.},

Here we investigate if these polymorphisms modulate both steatosis and fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. We recruited 515 patients with NAFLD (age 16–88 years, 280 female patients). Liver biopsies were performed in 320 patients. PCR-based assays were used to genotype the \textit{PNPLA3}, \textit{TM6SF2}, and \textit{MBOAT7} variants. Carriers of the \textit{PNPLA3} and \textit{TM6SF2} risk alleles showed increased serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase activities (\textit{P} {\textless} 0.05). The \textit{PNPLA3} genotype was associated with steatosis grades S2–S3 (\textit{P} {\textless} 0.001) and fibrosis stages F2–F4 (\textit{P} {\textless} 0.001). The \textit{TM6SF2} genotype was associated with steatosis (\textit{P} = 0.003) but not with fibrosis (\textit{P} {\textgreater} 0.05). The \textit{MBOAT7} variant was solely associated with increased fibrosis (\textit{P} = 0.046). In the multivariate model, variants \textit{PNPLA3} (\textit{P} = 0.004) and \textit{TM6SF2} (\textit{P} = 0.038) were associated with steatosis. Fibrosis stages were affected by the \textit{PNPLA3} (\textit{P} = 0.042) and \textit{MBOAT7} (\textit{P} = 0.021) but not by the \textit{TM6SF2} polymorphism (\textit{P} {\textgreater} 0.05). The \textit{PNPLA3}, \textit{TM6SF2}, and \textit{MBOAT7} variants are associated with increased liver injury. The \textit{TM6SF2} variant seems to modulate predominantly hepatic fat accumulation, whereas the \textit{MBOAT7} polymorphism is linked to fibrosis. The \textit{PNPLA3} polymorphism confers risk of both increased steatosis and fibrosis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Introduction and aim
This study aimed to confirm the association of the transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2) E167K variant with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the degree of steatosis, as well as the additive effect of body mass index (BMI) or the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) I148M and TM6SF2 E167K variants in NAFLD.
Materials and methods
A total of 158 NAFLD patients and 158 matched controls were recruited. Steatosis was classified as mild, moderate and severe by FibroScan. Associations between the TM6SF2 E167K variant and NAFLD as well as clinical parameters were evaluated.
Results
Although the frequency of the T allele was low in the Chinese population (MAF=7.4\%), there was still a significant association between the E167K variant and NAFLD (odds ratio=3.379, 95\% confidence interval: 1.500–7.612, P=0.003). In particular, the TM6SF2 genotype was also associated with the degree of steatosis (P=0.023). The TM6SF2 variant was associated with increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) but no other clinical parameters, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lipids. Notably, we also found that an additive effect of the TM6SF2 E167K and PNPLA3 I148M variants in NAFLD. Furthermore, we did not identify an association between the TM6SF2 E167K variant and NAFLD in the non-obese population.
Conclusion
The TM6SF2 E167K variant was associated with NAFLD in northeast China, and there was an interaction between the PNPLA3 I148M and TMS6F2 E167K variants in NAFLD.},

	abstract = {Introduction and objectives
PNPLA3 (rs738409) and TM6SF2 (rs58542926) variants, interindividual and ethnic differences may be risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The PNPLA3 G allele is associated with worse NAFLD evolution in Hispanics and Caucasians. TM6SF2 is associated with hypertriglyceridemia, NAFLD, and cardiovascular disease. We aimed to evaluate the association between genetic ancestry by Ancestry Informative Markers (AIM), PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 polymorphisms in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD in an admixed population.
Methods
We included adults with biopsy-proven NAFLD and excluded patients with the presence of other chronic liver disease, alcohol intake {\textgreater}100g/week, HIV, drug-induced fatty liver disease, or liver transplantation. We classified NAFLD using the Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH-CRN) histological scoring system. The PNPLA3 (rs738409 c.444C{\textgreater}G) and TM6SF2 (rs58542926 c.449C{\textgreater}T) genotyping were performed by RT-PCR. Genetic ancestry was determined using 46 insertion-deletion AIM; α{\textless}0.05 was considered significant.
Results
A total of 248 patients with NAFLD were enrolled [34 with simple steatosis (NAFL); 214 with NASH]. Overall, we detected a greater European ancestry contribution (0.645), followed by African (0.173), Amerindian (0.095), and East Asian (0.087) ancestry contribution, without differences between NAFL and NASH patients. However, we found a higher African genetic ancestry contribution among patients with NAFL who had the PNPLA3 C/C genotype than those with the G allele (0.216 ± 0.205 versus 0.105 ± 0.101, respectively; p=0.047). Ancestry contributions did not differ among TM6SF2 genotypes.
Conclusion
Among NAFL patients, greater African genetic ancestry was associated to a lower frequency of the PNPLA3 G allele, demonstrating a possible NASH ancestry-related protective factor.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims We hypothesized that a genetic risk score (GRS) for fatty liver disease influences the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Three genetic variants (patatin-like phospholipase domain–containing protein 3 [PNPLA3] p.I148M; transmembrane 6, superfamily member 2 [TM6SF2] p.E167K; and hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 13 [HSD17B13] rs72613567) were combined into a risk score, ranging from 0 to 6 for risk-increasing alleles. Approach and Results We examined the association of the risk score with plasma markers of liver disease and with cirrhosis and HCC in 110,761 individuals from Copenhagen, Denmark, and 334,691 individuals from the UK Biobank. The frequencies of risk scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 or 6 were 5\%, 25\%, 41\%, 23\%, 5.5\%, and 0.5\%, respectively. A higher GRS was associated with an increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 26\% in those with score 5 or 6 versus 0. In meta-analysis of the Copenhagen studies and the UK Biobank, individuals with scores 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 or 6 had odds ratios (ORs) for cirrhosis of 1.6 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.3, 1.9), 2.0 (95\% CI, 1.8, 2.2), 3.1 (95\% CI, 2.7, 3.5), 5.2 (95\% CI, 4.2, 6.4), and 12 (95\% CI, 7.7, 19), respectively, as compared with those with a score of 0. The corresponding ORs for HCC were 1.2 (95\% CI, 0.9, 1.7), 1.0 (95\% CI, 0.7, 1.3), 2.4 (95\% CI, 1.9, 3.0), 3.3 (95\% CI, 2.2, 5.0), and 29 (95\% CI, 17, 51). Conclusion A GRS for fatty liver disease confers up to a 12-fold higher risk of cirrhosis and up to a 29-fold higher risk of HCC in individuals from the general population.},

	abstract = {Objective
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming a leading cause of advanced chronic liver disease. The progression of NAFLD, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), has a strong genetic component, and the most robust contributor is the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) rs738409 encoding the 148M protein sequence variant. We hypothesized that suppressing the expression of the PNPLA3 148M mutant protein would exert a beneficial effect on the entire spectrum of NAFLD.
Methods
We examined the effects of liver-targeted GalNAc3-conjugated antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated silencing of Pnpla3 in a knock-in mouse model in which we introduced the human PNPLA3 I148M mutation.
Results
ASO-mediated silencing of Pnpla3 reduced liver steatosis (p = 0.038) in homozygous Pnpla3 148M/M knock-in mutant mice but not in wild-type littermates fed a steatogenic high-sucrose diet. In mice fed a NASH-inducing diet, ASO-mediated silencing of Pnpla3 reduced liver steatosis score and NAFLD activity score independent of the Pnpla3 genotype, while reductions in liver inflammation score (p = 0.018) and fibrosis stage (p = 0.031) were observed only in the Pnpla3 knock-in 148M/M mutant mice. These responses were accompanied by reduced liver levels of Mcp1 (p = 0.026) and Timp2 (p = 0.007) specifically in the mutant knock-in mice. This may reduce levels of chemokine attracting inflammatory cells and increase the collagenolytic activity during tissue regeneration.
Conclusion
This study provides the first evidence that a Pnpla3 ASO therapy can improve all features of NAFLD, including liver fibrosis, and suppress the expression of a strong innate genetic risk factor, Pnpla3 148M, which may open up a precision medicine approach in NASH.},

	abstract = {Background and Aim Lifestyle modification is the cornerstone for the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and patatin-like phospholipase 3 (PNPLA3) is one of the most important genetic determinants of NAFLD. We aimed to investigate the effect of PNPLA3 gene polymorphism on the response to lifestyle modification in NAFLD patients. Methods This was a post-hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial on a lifestyle modification program in community NAFLD patients. The PNPLA3 rs738409 gene polymorphism was correlated with changes in metabolic profile and intrahepatic triglyceride content (IHTG) as measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results One hundred and fifty-four patients were equally randomized into the intervention and control groups. The presence of G allele was associated with greater reduction in IHTG (CC: 3.7 ± 5.2\%, CG: 6.5 ± 3.6\%), and GG: 11.3 ± 8.8\% (Spearman's correlation, 0.34; P = 0.002), body weight (P = 0.030), waist-to-hip ratio (P = 0.024), total cholesterol (P = 0.031), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.009) in the intervention group. In contrast, PNPLA3 polymorphism had no impact on IHTG changes in the control group. By multivariable analysis, PNPLA3 genotype and body mass index (BMI) change were independently associated with IHTG reduction in the intervention group. Only BMI change was associated with IHTG reduction in the control group. Conclusion Although the PNPLA3 rs738409 GG genotype confers a higher risk of NAFLD, these patients are more sensitive to the beneficial effects of lifestyle modification and should be encouraged to do so.},

	abstract = {Background \& Aims
Genetic variation in both patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein-3 (PNPLA3) (I148M) and the transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 protein (TM6SF2) (E167K) influences severity of liver disease, and serum triglyceride concentrations in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but whether either genotype influences the responses to treatments is uncertain.
Methods
One hundred three patients with NAFLD were randomised to omega-3 fatty acids (DHA+EPA) or placebo for 15–18months in a double blind placebo controlled trial. Erythrocyte enrichment with DHA and EPA was measured by gas chromatography. PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 genotypes were measured by PCR technologies. Multivariable linear regression and analysis of covariance were undertaken to test the effect of genotypes on omega-3 fatty acid enrichment, end of study liver fat percentage and serum triglyceride concentrations. All models were adjusted for baseline measurements of each respective outcome.
Results
Fifty-five men and 40 women (Genotypes PNPLA3 I148M, 148I/I=41, 148I/M=43, 148M/M=11; TM6SF2 E167K 167E/E=78, 167E/K+167K/K=17 participants) (mean±SD age, 51±11years) completed the trial. Adjusting for baseline measurement, measured covariates and confounders, PNPLA3 148M/M variant was independently associated with percentage of DHA enrichment (B coefficient −1.02 (95\% CI −1.97, −0.07), p=0.036) but not percentage of EPA enrichment (B coefficient −0.31 (95\% CI −1.38, 0.75), p=0.56). This genotype was also independently associated with end of study liver fat percentage (B coefficient 9.5 (95\% CI 2.53, 16.39), p=0.008), but not end of study triglyceride concentration (B coefficient −0.11 (95\% CI −0.64, 0.42), p=0.68).
Conclusions
PNPLA3 148M/M variant influences the changes in liver fat and DHA tissue enrichment during the trial but not the change in serum triglyceride concentration.},

However, few data are available on their treatment response influence. The aim of this trial is to explore the effect derived from silybin-phospholipids complex (303 mg of silybin-phospholipids complex, 10 μg of vitamin D, and 15 mg of vitamin E twice a day for 6 months) oral administration in NAFLD patients carrying PNPLA3-rs738409, TM6SF2-rs58542926, or MBOAT7-rs641738 genetic variants. Materials and Methods: In all, 92 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients were grouped in 30 NAFLD wild type controls, 30 wild type treated patients, and 32 mutated treated ones. We assessed glycemia (FPG), insulinemia, HOMA-IR, aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (AST, ALT), C-reactive protein (CRP), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), stiffness, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), dietary daily intake, and physical activity at baseline and end of treatment. Results: The wild-type treated group showed a significant improvement of FPG, insulinemia, HOMA-IR, ALT, CRP, and TBARS (p {\textless} 0.05), whereas no improvements were recorded in the other two study groups. NAFLD wild type treated patients showed higher possibilities of useful therapeutic outcome (p {\textless} 0.01), obtained from the prescribed therapeutic regimen, independently from age, sex, comorbidities, medications, CAP, and stiffness in comparison to the mutated group. Discussion: The assessed mutations are independently associated with no response to a silybin-based therapeutic regimen and could be considered as useful predictive markers in this context.

	abstract = {Background \& Aims
The I148M Patatin-like Phospholipase Domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3), the rs641738 in the Membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain containing 7-transmembrane channel-like 4 (MBOAT7-TMC4) locus, and the E167K Transmembrane 6 Superfamily Member 2 (TM6SF2) polymorphisms represent the main predisposing factors to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development and progression. We previously generated a full knockout of MBOAT7 in HepG2 cells (MBOAT7-/-), homozygous for I148M PNPLA3. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the synergic impact of the 3 at-risk variants on liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a large cohort of NAFLD patients, and create in vitro models of genetic NAFLD by silencing TM6SF2 in both HepG2 and MBOAT7-/- cells.
Methods
NAFLD patients (n = 1380), of whom 121 had HCC, were stratified with a semiquantitative score ranging from 0 to 3 according to the number of PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and MBOAT7 at-risk variants. TM6SF2 was silenced in HepG2 (TM6SF2-/-) and MBOAT7-/- (MBOAT7-/-TM6SF2-/-) through Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9).
Results
In NAFLD patients, the additive weight of these mutations was associated with liver disease severity and an increased risk of developing HCC. In HepG2 cells, TM6SF2 silencing altered lipid composition and induced the accumulation of microvesicular lipid droplets (LDs), whereas the MBOAT7-/-TM6SF2-/- cells showed a mixed microvesicular/macrovesicular pattern of LDs. TM6SF2 deletion strongly affected endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria ultrastructures, thus increasing endoplasmic reticulum/oxidative stress. The mitochondrial number was increased in both TM6SF2-/- and MBOAT7-/-TM6SF2-/- models, suggesting an unbalancing in mitochondrial dynamics, and the silencing of both MBOAT7 and TM6SF2 impaired mitochondrial activity with a shift toward anaerobic glycolysis. MBOAT7-/-TM6SF2-/- cells also showed the highest proliferation rate. Finally, the re-overexpression of MBOAT7 and/or TM6SF2 reversed the metabolic and tumorigenic features observed in the compound knockout model.
Conclusions
The co-presence of the 3 at-risk variants impacts the NAFLD course in both patients and experimental models, affecting LD accumulation, mitochondrial functionality, and metabolic reprogramming toward HCC.},

NAFLD is a multi-factorial disease where the genetics, metabolic, and environmental factors interplay and modulate the disease’s development and progression. Several genetic polymorphisms have been identified and are associated with the disease risk. This mini-review discussed the NAFLD’s genetic polymorphisms and focusing on the differences in the findings between the populations (diversity), including of those reports that did not show any significant association. The challenges of genetic diversity are also summarized.

In the current study, we sought to identify genetic factors related to the development of NAFLD, NASH, and NASH-HCC, and to establish risk-estimation models for them. For these purposes, 936 histologically proven NAFLD patients were recruited, and genome-wide association (GWA) studies were conducted for 902, including 476 NASH and 58 NASH-HCC patients, against 7,672 general-population controls. Risk estimations for NAFLD and NASH were then performed using the SNPs identified as having significant associations in the GWA studies. We found that rs2896019 in PNPLA3 [p = 2.3x10-31, OR (95\%CI) = 1.85 (1.67–2.05)], rs1260326 in GCKR [p = 9.6x10-10, OR (95\%CI) = 1.38(1.25–1.53)], and rs4808199 in GATAD2A [p = 2.3x10-8, OR (95\%CI) = 1.37 (1.23–1.53)] were significantly associated with NAFLD. Notably, the number of risk alleles in PNPLA3 and GATAD2A was much higher in Matteoni type 4 (NASH) patients than in type 1, type 2, and type 3 NAFLD patients. In addition, we newly identified rs17007417 in DYSF [p = 5.2x10-7, OR (95\%CI) = 2.74 (1.84–4.06)] as a SNP associated with NASH-HCC. Rs641738 in TMC4, which showed association with NAFLD in patients of European descent, was not replicated in our study (p = 0.73), although the complicated LD pattern in the region suggests the necessity for further investigation. The genetic variants of PNPLA3, GCKR, and GATAD2A were then used to estimate the risk for NAFLD. The obtained Polygenic Risk Scores showed that the risk for NAFLD increased with the accumulation of risk alleles [AUC (95\%CI) = 0.65 (0.63–0.67)]. Conclusions: We demonstrated that NASH is genetically and clinically different from the other NAFLD subgroups. We also established risk-estimation models for NAFLD and NASH using multiple genetic markers. These models can be used to improve the accuracy of NAFLD diagnosis and to guide treatment decisions for patients.},

	abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus, a major human pathogen, has a collection of virulence factors and the ability to acquire resistance to most antibiotics. This ability is further augmented by constant emergence of new clones, making S. aureus a "superbug." Clinical use of methicillin has led to the appearance of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The past few decades have witnessed the existence of new MRSA clones. Unlike traditional MRSA residing in hospitals, the new clones can invade community settings and infect people without predisposing risk factors. This evolution continues with the buildup of the MRSA reservoir in companion and food animals. This review focuses on imparting a better understanding of MRSA evolution and its molecular characterization and epidemiology. We first describe the origin of MRSA, with emphasis on the diverse nature of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). mecA and its new homologues (mecB, mecC, and mecD), SCCmec types (13 SCCmec types have been discovered to date), and their classification criteria are discussed. The review then describes various typing methods applied to study the molecular epidemiology and evolutionary nature of MRSA. Starting with the historical methods and continuing to the advanced whole-genome approaches, typing of collections of MRSA has shed light on the origin, spread, and evolutionary pathways of MRSA clones.},

	abstract = {Salmonellosis remains one of the most frequent food-borne zoonoses, constituting a worldwide major public health concern. Currently, at a global level, the main sources of infection for humans include meat products, including the consumption of contaminated poultry meat, in spite of the success of Salmonella control measures implemented in food-animal production of industrialized countries. In recent years, a shift in Salmonella serotypes related to poultry and poultry production has been reported in diverse geographical regions, being particularly associated with the spread of certain well-adapted clones. Moreover, antimicrobial resistance in non-typhoidal Salmonella is considered one of the major public health threats related with food-animal production, including the poultry production chain and poultry meat, which is an additional concern in the management of salmonellosis. The circulation of the same multidrug-resistant Salmonella clones and/or identical mobile genetic elements encoding antibiotic resistance genes from poultry to humans highlights this scenario. The purpose of this review was to provide an overview of the role of poultry meat on salmonellosis at a global scale and the main problems that could hinder the success of Salmonella control measures at animal production level. With the increasing globalization of foodstuffs like poultry meat, new problems and challenges might arise regarding salmonellosis control, making new integrated intervention strategies necessary along the food chain.},

This systematic review (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews [PROSPERO] ID: CRD42020156674) is the first to determine the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance to fluoroquinolones in women with community-acquired uUTI. PubMed and Embase searches were conducted; 38 studies fulfilled eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review. Within Europe, ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli isolates varied between countries and increased in some from 2006 to 2008 and 2014 to 2016, specifically in the United Kingdom (0.5\% to 15.3\%), Germany (8.7\% to 15.1\%), and Spain (22.9\% to 30.8\%), although methodologies and settings were often not comparable. In Asia, there was a substantial increase in ciprofloxacin resistance during 2008 to 2014 from 25\% to more than 40\%. In North America, resistance to ciprofloxacin also increased between 2008 and 2017, from 4\% to 12\%. Data exploring different age groups did not show a consistent relationship with resistance, whereas two studies found that fluoroquinolone resistance was higher in postmenopausal women than premenopausal women. One study indicated a link between fluoroquinolone resistance and uUTI recurrence. These findings may have implications for the empirical treatment of uUTI with fluoroquinolones globally, but more data are needed to fully understand regional situations and impact patient management.},

In this study, we determined mutations in gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE among 57 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli isolates from a South Korean hospital and analysed the relationship between the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of fluoroquinolones and mutations in the topoisomerase IV gene. All ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli isolates carried double mutations in gyrA and at least a single mutation in parC; some isolates also carried a single mutation in parE. The most common mutations were S83L and D87N in gyrA, S80I in parC and S458A in parE, which accounted for 25\% of isolates. Single mutations in parE at L445I, S458P and S458W were identified for the first time. Double mutations in parC and a combination of single mutations in parC and parE significantly increased the MIC values of fluoroquinolones. In vitro induction of resistance to ciprofloxacin showed that double mutations in gyrA were a prerequisite to conferring a resistant phenotype to fluoroquinolones, and an additional mutation in the topoisomerase IV gene increased the MIC values of ciprofloxacin. In conclusion, emergence of a new mutation in parC and parE and its accumulation induces high levels of resistance to fluoroquinolones in E. coli.},

Historically, quinolone resistance was the result of chromosomal mutations, but plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) has emerged and is increasingly being reported in Enterobacteriaceae worldwide. PMQR may facilitate the spread of quinolone resistance, lead to higher-level quinolone resistance, and make infections harder to treat. To better understand the epidemiology of PMQR in non-typhoidal Salmonella causing human infections in the United States, we looked at trends in quinolone resistance among isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We reviewed demographic, exposure and outcome information for patients with isolates having a PMQR-associated phenotype during 2008–2014 and tested isolates for quinolone resistance mechanisms. We found that PMQR is emerging among non-typhoidal Salmonella causing human infections in the United States and that international travel, reptile and amphibian exposure, and food are likely sources of human infection.},

He described it as an encapsulated bacillus after isolating the bacterium from the lungs of those who had died from pneumonia. Originally named Friedlander's bacillus, it was not until 1886 that the bacterium garnered the name Klebsiella. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a gram-negative, encapsulated, non-motile bacterium found in the environment and has been associated with pneumonia in patient populations with alcohol use disorder or diabetes mellitus. The bacterium typically colonizes human mucosal surfaces of the oropharynx and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Once the bacterium enters the body, it can display high degrees of virulence and antibiotic resistance. Today, K. pneumoniae pneumonia is considered the most common cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia in the United States, and the organism accounts for 3\% to 8\% of all nosocomial bacterial infections.},

Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) profiles of seven core virulence genes were used to classify unambiguously isolates of MRSA from St George's Hospital into two groups corresponding to EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16. Variants of both EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16 isolates occurred that had lost virulence genes encoded on mobile genetic elements. EMRSA-16 isolates had core gene profiles identical to a cluster of previously characterised MSSA (methicillin-sensitive S. aureus) isolates from St George's Hospital, suggesting that they have arisen from this source, or that loss of the accessory genetic element encoding methicillin resistance is frequent. EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16 strains were distinct from other MRSA strains previously identified in UK hospitals, and always carried a mobile genetic element encoding multiple superantigens. These results contribute to the understanding of the types of MRSA found in UK hospitals, how they vary and how they arose.},

Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) profiles of seven core virulence genes were used to classify unambiguously isolates of MRSA from St George's Hospital into two groups corresponding to EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16. Variants of both EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16 isolates occurred that had lost virulence genes encoded on mobile genetic elements. EMRSA-16 isolates had core gene profiles identical to a cluster of previously characterised MSSA (methicillin-sensitive S. aureus) isolates from St George's Hospital, suggesting that they have arisen from this source, or that loss of the accessory genetic element encoding methicillin resistance is frequent. EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16 strains were distinct from other MRSA strains previously identified in UK hospitals, and always carried a mobile genetic element encoding multiple superantigens. These results contribute to the understanding of the types of MRSA found in UK hospitals, how they vary and how they arose.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health threat, and antimicrobial usage and AMR in animal production is one of its contributing sources. Poultry is one of the most widespread types of meat consumed worldwide. Poultry flocks are often raised under intensive conditions using large amounts of antimicrobials to prevent and to treat disease, as well as for growth promotion. Antimicrobial resistant poultry pathogens may result in treatment failure, leading to economic losses, but also be a source of resistant bacteria/genes (including zoonotic bacteria) that may represent a risk to human health. Here we reviewed data on AMR in 12 poultry pathogens, including avian pathogenic {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Escherichia coli{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} (APEC), {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Salmonella{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} Pullorum/Gallinarum, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Pasteurella multocida, Avibacterium paragallinarum, Gallibacterium anatis, Ornitobacterium rhinotracheale{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} (ORT), {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Bordetella avium, Clostridium perfringens, Mycoplasma{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} spp., {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Riemerella anatipestifer{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}.

Among the Gram-negative, non-Enterobacteriaceae pathogens, ORT had the highest levels of phenotypic resistance with median levels of AMR against co-trimoxazole, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, amoxicillin, and ceftiofur all exceeding 50\%. In contrast, levels of resistance among {\textless}italic{\textgreater}P. multocida{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} isolates were less than 20\% for all antimicrobials. The study highlights considerable disparities in methodologies, as well as in criteria for phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing and result interpretation.

	abstract = {The genetic polymorphism I148M of patatin‐like phospholipase domain–containing 3 (PNPLA3) is robustly associated with hepatic steatosis and its progression to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cancer. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are key players in the development of liver fibrosis, but the role of PNPLA3 and its variant I148M in this process is poorly understood. Here we analyzed the expression of PNPLA3 during human HSC activation and thereby explored how a PNPLA3 variant impacts hepatic fibrogenesis. We show that expression of PNPLA3 gene and protein increases during the early phases of activation and remains elevated in fully activated HSCs (P {\textless} 0.01). Knockdown of PNPLA3 significantly decreases the profibrogenic protein alpha‐smooth muscle actin (P {\textless} 0.05). Primary human I148M HSCs displayed significantly higher expression and release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as chemokine (C‐C motif) ligand 5 (P {\textless} 0.01) and granulocyte‐macrophage colony‐stimulating factor (P {\textless} 0.001), thus contributing to migration of immune cells (P {\textless} 0.05). Primary I148M HSCs showed reduced retinol (P {\textless} 0.001) but higher lipid droplet content (P {\textless} 0.001). In line with this, LX‐2 cells stably overexpressing I148M showed augmented proliferation and migration, lower retinol, and abolished retinoid X receptor/retinoid A receptor transcriptional activities but more lipid droplets. Knockdown of I148M PNPLA3 (P {\textless} 0.001) also reduces chemokine (C‐C motif) ligand 5 and collagen1α1 expression (P {\textless} 0.05). Notably, I148M cells display reduced peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma transcriptional activity, and this effect was attributed to increased c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase, thereby inhibiting peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma through serine 84 phosphorylation and promoting activator protein 1 transcription. Conversely, the c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125 and the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma agonist rosiglitazone decreased activator protein 1 promoter activity. Conclusions: These data indicate that PNPLA3 is required for HSC activation and that its genetic variant I148M potentiates the profibrogenic features of HSCs, providing a molecular mechanism for the higher risk of progression and severity of liver diseases conferred to patients carrying the I148M variant.

	abstract = {People with severe mental illness (SMI) – schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder – appear at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), but a comprehensive meta-analysis is lacking. We conducted a large-scale meta-analysis assessing the prevalence and incidence of CVD; coronary heart disease; stroke, transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular disease; congestive heart failure; peripheral vascular disease; and CVD-related death in SMI patients (N=3,211,768) versus controls (N=113,383,368) (92 studies). The pooled CVD prevalence in SMI patients (mean age 50 years) was 9.9\% (95\% CI: 7.4-13.3). Adjusting for a median of seven confounders, patients had significantly higher odds of CVD versus controls in cross-sectional studies (odds ratio, OR=1.53, 95\% CI: 1.27-1.83; 11 studies), and higher odds of coronary heart disease (OR=1.51, 95\% CI: 1.47-1.55) and cerebrovascular disease (OR=1.42, 95\% CI: 1.21-1.66). People with major depressive disorder were at increased risk for coronary heart disease, while those with schizophrenia were at increased risk for coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and congestive heart failure. Cumulative CVD incidence in SMI patients was 3.6\% (95\% CI: 2.7-5.3) during a median follow-up of 8.4 years (range 1.8-30.0). Adjusting for a median of six confounders, SMI patients had significantly higher CVD incidence than controls in longitudinal studies (hazard ratio, HR=1.78, 95\% CI: 1.60-1.98; 31 studies). The incidence was also higher for coronary heart disease (HR=1.54, 95\% CI: 1.30-1.82), cerebrovascular disease (HR=1.64, 95\% CI: 1.26-2.14), congestive heart failure (HR=2.10, 95\% CI: 1.64-2.70), and CVD-related death (HR=1.85, 95\% CI: 1.53-2.24). People with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia were all at increased risk of CVD-related death versus controls. CVD incidence increased with antipsychotic use (p=0.008), higher body mass index (p=0.008) and higher baseline CVD prevalence (p=0.03) in patients vs. controls. Moreover, CVD prevalence (p=0.007), but not CVD incidence (p=0.21), increased in more recently conducted studies. This large-scale meta-analysis confirms that SMI patients have significantly increased risk of CVD and CVD-related mortality, and that elevated body mass index, antipsychotic use, and CVD screening and management require urgent clinical attention.},
