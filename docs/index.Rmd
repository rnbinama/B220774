## **Introduction**
Mental health and cardiovascular disease are two of the most pressing public health challenges facing Scotland today, with the recent 2022 census revealing that Mental Health conditions have worsened since 2011. The intricate relationship between these conditions is well-documented, with mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety often acting as both risk factors for and consequences of heart disease. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), widely prescribed for the treatment of mental health disorders, offer valuable insights into trends in mental health management. Meanwhile, heart disease mortality rates provide a way to examine the broader impacts of mental and physical health on public health outcomes.@herman_cell_2014

This assessment explores the intersection of mental health and heart disease mortality in Scotland by visualizing combined trends in SSRI prescriptions for fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram. It highlights how mental health and heart disease evolve over time, noting that higher SSRI use in areas of greater socioeconomic deprivation may align with increased heart disease mortality.

Without conducting analysis, this report presents a cohesive and detailed overview of the data, offering foundation for future exploration of these critical public health issues.

## **Mental Health In-Patient Admissions and Antidepressant Prescription Trends 2015-2023**

### Mental Health In-Patient Admission Cases Data Preparation
The increase in mental health cases in Scotland is accommodated by increased community-based care which includes more prescriptions of antidepressants like Metrazipine, accompanied by a decrease in the in-patient admissions cases for mental health cases. The following plot demonstrate the trends of antidepressant prescriptions and the inpatient admissions in Scotland between 2015 and 2023. *Note that financial year is represented by the second year within the timeframe.

```{r Inpatient Mental Health, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
### Data Import

#First the open data csv file is read in using tidyverse, a hyperlink sourcing the data is included to ensure information is up-to-date
Mental_health_total <- read_csv("https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/4ace86c2-2c0f-4620-b544-932148c2c4d3/resource/7e99efb9-2d73-46e1-bdce-59b00ed20a0f/download/20231212-mental-health-inpatient-activity-health-board-trend.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()  # Part of the janitor library, this ensures names of objects are standardised e.g. conversion to lowercase
```

```{r Inpatient Mental Health1, echo=TRUE, include=FALSE}
# Check for inaccuracies and understand value types for the data I am interested in using. Financial year is a character and should be numeric.
str(Mental_health_total)
```

```{r Inpatient Mental Health2, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
### Data Wrangling

#Next Data is tidied, changing the format
Filtered_MH_total <- Mental_health_total %>%

#The SMR04 code in the 'dataset' column represents Mental Health case Data in Scotland. Filter for this and the years following 2015
  filter(dataset == "SMR04", financial_year >="2014/15") %>%  
#This step renders 'financial_year' column numeric for data visualisation through plots, representation of quantitative data. 'sub()' substitutes characters before and including "/" with "20", then converted to numeric format
   mutate(financial_year = as.numeric(sub(".*/", "20", financial_year))) %>%
  select(Year=financial_year, Admissions=number_of_admissions) %>%  # Select required columns for plotting and rename for easy plotting
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarise(MeanAdmissions = mean(Admissions, na.rm = TRUE)) # Calculate mean admissions per year for standarised measure over time
```

###Antidepressant Data Preparation
In this next section, the antidepressant data is imported and wrangled before the combined plot can be created. The antidepressants selected include; Mirtazapine, a oradrenaline and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NASSA), Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), Venlafaxine, a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). 
```{r AD_Drugs, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
### Data Import

#To import antidepressant prescription information from 2015 to 2023, dataset csv files of the months October, November, December, are downloaded from https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/prescriptions-in-the-community and added to the folder named "WinterDrugs2015-2023". This is to ensure the time frame of data collected was maximised. Prescription data for 2015 was only available during these months.

# All CSV files listed in the specified directory
ADFiles <- list.files(here("docs","WinterDrugs2015-2023"), pattern = "csv")

# Function defined to read and process each CSV file cohesively
ReadADFiles <- function(file_name) {
  # Extract the year from the file name using lubridate package in tidyverse. This enables plotting with Year as a variable
  year <- str_extract(file_name, "\\d{4}") %>% as.numeric()
  # Read the CSV file, process the data add year column
  data <- read_csv(here("docs","WinterDrugs2015-2023", file_name), show_col_types = FALSE,  col_types = cols(.default = "c")) %>% # Convert all columns to character type to avoid warnings due to inconsistent data types
    mutate(Year = year, PaidQuantity = as.numeric(PaidQuantity)) %>% # Specifically convert paid quantity to numeric format because the data contains numbers, allows for mathematical operations (e.g sum(), mean())
#Filter for specific antidepressants
    filter(str_detect(BNFItemDescription, "MIRTAZAPINE|FLUOXETINE|VENLAFAXINE|AMITRIPTYLINE"),) %>%
    return(data)
}
# This applies the ReadADFiles function to all the CSV files and combines the results, the large amount of data
ADs_Df <- ADFiles %>%
  map_dfr(ReadADFiles)
```

```{r AD_Drugs1, echo=TRUE, include=FALSE}
#Examine the dataframe structure and check for inaccuracies and value types
str(ADs_Df)
# Note, there are two columns depicting the same health board code information but through different years, "HBT2014" and "HBT". This is an inconsistency, they should be consolidated into a single column for further data manipulation 
```

```{r AD_Drugs2, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
### Data Wrangling

# The data is cleaned again using janitor, and transformed  
Clean_ADs_Df <- ADs_Df %>%
# HBT2014 and HBT columns are combined into a new column called HB, prioritising data from the HBT column as this represents the most recent datasets
  mutate(HB = coalesce(HBT, HBT2014), 
#Antidepressants are categorised based on BNFItemDescription which is the British National Formulary information on medicines administered in the United Kingdom.
         Antidepressant = case_when(
             str_detect(BNFItemDescription, "MIRTAZAPINE") ~ "Mirtazapine(NASSA)",
             str_detect(BNFItemDescription, "FLUOXETINE") ~ "Fluoxetine(SSRI)",
             str_detect(BNFItemDescription, "VENLAFAXINE") ~ "Venlafaxine(SNRI)",
             str_detect(BNFItemDescription, "AMITRIPTYLINE") ~ "Amitriptyline(TCA)",
             TRUE ~ NA_character_  # Leave as NA if it doesn't match any MH Drug
           )) %>%  # Create 'hb' from HBT2014 or hbt
  select(-HBT2014, -HBT, HB, Year, PaidQuantity) %>% # select only relevant columns
  filter(!is.na(PaidQuantity)) # ensure there are no "NA" cells in the "PaidQuantity" column which is important in preventing inaccuracies in calculations or summaries, this could also lead to incomplete or misleading visualisations
```


###Healthboard Names Data Preparation 
This data is imported so health board codes can be represented by the actual names for easiness and tidiness.

```{r HB, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
### Import Data

# Hyperlink to ensure efficiency in import and that the data is up-to-date
HBName_Data <- read_csv("https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/9f942fdb-e59e-44f5-b534-d6e17229cc7b/resource/652ff726-e676-4a20-abda-435b98dd7bdc/download/hb14_hb19.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()


### Data Wrangling 

# Join the health board names with antidepressant data frame using health board code depicted in concatenation
ADs_HBNames <- full_join(Clean_ADs_Df, HBName_Data, by = c("HB" = "hb")) %>% 
  rename(Healthboard = hb_name,
         Code = HB,
         Count = PaidQuantity)%>% # Rename for clarity
  select(Year, Count, Healthboard, Code, Antidepressant) #Select desired columns for plotting


```

### Combined Plot Visualisation
The data have been prepared and tidied, and are ready for visualising in a combined plot. This plot demonstrates the trend in in-Patient admission cases and antidepressant usage from 2015-2023 to show the change in antidepressant usage and community-based care.
```{r Combined_AD_MH, echo=TRUE, include=FALSE}
### Data Wrangling

# Use 'full_join' to combine the antidepressants with health board names dataframe and the average mental health in-Patient cases, to ensure no data is lost and format for plotting is correct
# This also highlights why it's important for the Year variable in 'Filtered_MH_total' to be numeric, so chronological alignment is successful
Combined_data<- full_join(ADs_HBNames, Filtered_MH_total, by = "Year")
str(Combined_data)
```

### Summary 
There has been a slight decrease in the number of in-Patient Mental Health cases, whilst all types of antidepressant prescriptions during OCT-DEC have increased, even during the years of the COVID-19 pandemic, rates continued to increase. From this plot, an increase in the number of antidepressants indicates a decline in mental health in Scotland.


## **Heart Disease Mortality Rates 2015-2023**
In this section, the heart disease mortaility data is obtained from the same website as the prescriptions in the community: https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/scottish-heart-disease-statistics. Data is visualised to view the change in the rate of heart disease deaths and what differences occur amoung age groups, during the same period of time antidepressant usage is rapidly increasing.

```{r HD_Plot, echo=TRUE, include=FALSE}

  clean_names() %>% # Cleaned for clarity
  filter(!is.na(number_of_deaths)) # To ensure no NA that'll affect further manipulation


### Data Wrangling

# Next, data is filtered for 2015 on wards, and renamed, with appropriate columns selected for plotting.
filtered_HD_total <- HeartD_mortality %>% 
  filter(year >= 2015) %>%
  select(year, hbr, death_count=number_of_deaths, age_group) %>%

```
### Summary
After facet wrapping the heart disease mortality total deaths in a year by age, there has generally been an increase in most age groups, with 0-44 years not altering much. The calculation at the end shows that 45-64 year-olds had the greatest increase in total deaths between 2015 and 2023.

## **Map of Healthboards by Mitrazipine Prescription Per Person in 2019**
In this section, the population data is downloaded as a csv file and obtained using here(). Data is visualised to view the differences in Mitrazipine prescriptions per person in different healthboards across Scotland. This information will then be used to determine whether there is a difference in the heart disease mortality statistics when prescriptions are high versus low. The spatial map files have been downloaded from this website (https://spatialdata.gov.scot/geonetwork/srv/api/records/f12c3826-4b4b-40e6-bf4f-77b9ed01dc14) and saved into a folder name "Shape". Both open datasets were published in 2019.

### Summary
By observing the map, we can see that Mirtazapine prescription per person is high in 'NHS Ayrshire and Arran' and low in 'NHS Highland', as depicted by the viridis colour scale. Other higher usage areas include 'NHS Glasgow and Clyde' and 'NHS Lanarkshire', and lower includes 'NHS Lothian'. As Mirtazapine is often reserved as a last line antidpressant to patients with severe depression and failed first-line treatment with SSRIs or SNRIs, this indicates that depression levels may be greater in these areas.

## **Table with heart disease differences when Mirtazapine prescription is high and low**
It is now interesting to determine what differences exist in the statistics regarding heart disease mortality in 'NHS Ayrshire and Arran' with high Mitrazapine prescription per person and 'NHS Highland' with low Mitrazapine prescription per person. Comparison is also encouraged by the fact that the populations of these health boards are similar. The gt table produced in this section will group by the 45-64 years age group as they demonstrated greatest increase in deaths.

```{r HD_Mirt_Table, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

## SSRIs Mechanisms and Heart Disease
Summary with clincal study demonstrating that there is a link between poor mental health and heart disease (Scotland group and Australian Cohort, large percentage of people who experienced cardiac failure had poor mental health, invclude study statistucs). Additionally, the detrimental physiological effect of SSRIs on cardiovascular health (Breifly describe the biological mechanisms). Explanations and why

### SSRI Prescriptions and Heart Disease Mortality by Healthbord at a specific time (2022, November)
Gt table to demonstrate the differences between SSRI prescription trends in a health board with high deprivation and one with low deprivation SMID(index number). And show SSRI usage per person (using hb_population data) and compare this with heart condition data (try and include standardised format).(This can demonstrate that there is evidence for more deaths where more SSRIs are taken?!?)
*Gt table should show that in healthboard with more SSRI intake, there's more heart mortality and vice versa for low deprivation*
*Table will also include demographics of deaths including sex, age. Older population is dying more from heart failure and men too, but this isn't related to depression data (will be clearly stated, just mentioned)*


##Discussions
###Recommendations/Policy/Regaulation
###Conclusive Remarks and significance of study


##Other suggestions
- Include Metformin usage as well, create a link there as another secondary risk factor
- Heart disease medication prescriptions and trends, particularly the recent introduction of Anticoagulant. (But this technically hasnt helped as such)
